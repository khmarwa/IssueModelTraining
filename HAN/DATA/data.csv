I had ordered a data cable, got a very well finished and working product.;NOTISSUE
Love This Phone.;NOTISSUE
I get a very well finished product.;NOTISSUE
I could not be happier.;NOTISSUE
I was looking for this headset for a long time and now I have got it;NOTISSUE
my headset starts ringing for no reason.;ISSUE
Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.;NOTISSUE
Battery life is also great!;NOTISSUE
The worst phone I have ever had.... Only had it for a few months.;ISSUE
Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.;ISSUE
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.;ISSUE
Protects the phone on all sides.;NOTISSUE
This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.;ISSUE
Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range.;NOTISSUE
Soyo technology sucks.;ISSUE
Great Hands Free Device.;NOTISSUE
you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool.;NOTISSUE
Same problem as others have mentioned.;ISSUE
After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.;NOTISSUE
Magical Help.;NOTISSUE
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.;ISSUE
Poor sound quality.;ISSUE
The best phone in market :).;NOTISSUE
It worked very well.;NOTISSUE
The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.;NOTISSUE
Exactly what I wanted.;NOTISSUE
The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.;ISSUE
This is a great deal.;NOTISSUE
Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase.;NOTISSUE
I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.;NOTISSUE
Better than you'd expect.;NOTISSUE
Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear.;ISSUE
Great product and price.;NOTISSUE
Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !;NOTISSUE
what a disappointment;ISSUE
Very prompt service.;NOTISSUE
Excellent product for the price.;NOTISSUE
Very pleased with this headset.;NOTISSUE
do not waste your money and time.;ISSUE
I especially love the long battery life.;NOTISSUE
It is so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.;ISSUE
Works great.;NOTISSUE
Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.;NOTISSUE
I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.;ISSUE
I will be looking for a new earpiece.;NOTISSUE
I will be looking for a new earpiece.Jawbone Era is awesome too!;NOTISSUE
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement;ISSUE
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.;ISSUE
I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best.;NOTISSUE
An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.;NOTISSUE
This is the first phone I have had that has been so cheaply made.;NOTISSUE
Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.;ISSUE
Price is good too.;NOTISSUE
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.;ISSUE
Do not make the same mistake I did.;ISSUE
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.;ISSUE
I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.;NOTISSUE
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.;ISSUE
Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.;NOTISSUE
every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.;NOTISSUE
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.;ISSUE
It is REALLY EASY.;NOTISSUE
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.;NOTISSUE
Fantastic earphones.;NOTISSUE
It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.;NOTISSUE
Low Quality;ISSUE
But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I have had before.;NOTISSUE
Warning - Stay away.;ISSUE
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.;ISSUE
Awsome Device Works Great!!.;NOTISSUE
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.;ISSUE
If you do not find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.;NOTISSUE
Very Displeased.;ISSUE
I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.;NOTISSUE
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.;ISSUE
Restored my phone to like new performance.;NOTISSUE
I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.;NOTISSUE
I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.;NOTISSUE
Does not fit.;ISSUE
Very happy with this product.;NOTISSUE
The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.;NOTISSUE
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.;NOTISSUE
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it was not high priced.;NOTISSUE
Portable and it works.;NOTISSUE
My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.;NOTISSUE
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.;ISSUE
I have also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.;ISSUE
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.;ISSUE
Timely shipment and quality product.;NOTISSUE
Nice solid keyboard.;NOTISSUE
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.;NOTISSUE
Horrible phone.;ISSUE
BT50 battery junk!.;ISSUE
We would recommend these to others.;NOTISSUE
Can not get the software to work with my computer.;ISSUE
Disappointed!.;ISSUE
poor voice clarity.;ISSUE
The battery works great!;NOTISSUE
No buyers remorse on this one!.;NOTISSUE
Very disappointed in Accessory.;ISSUE
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.;ISSUE
"Looks great and is strong.""";NOTISSUE
I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.;NOTISSUE
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.;NOTISSUE
Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.;ISSUE
Great software for Motorolas.;NOTISSUE
The delivery was on time.;NOTISSUE
Very easy to use.;NOTISSUE
Uncomfortable In the Ear, Do notuse with LG VX9900 (EnV).;ISSUE
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.;ISSUE
It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.;NOTISSUE
I'd like to return it.;ISSUE
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I do not expect any problems.;NOTISSUE
Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.;ISSUE
After charging overnight, these batteries work great.;NOTISSUE
You wil not regret it!;NOTISSUE
I love this phone!.;NOTISSUE
A Disappointment.;ISSUE
It is not user friendly.;ISSUE
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.;ISSUE
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.;ISSUE
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.;ISSUE
This PDA rocks.;NOTISSUE
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.;NOTISSUE
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!;NOTISSUE
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.;NOTISSUE
Pretty piece of junk.;ISSUE
Plug was the wrong size.;ISSUE
Works as described.;NOTISSUE
Save your money.... I have had this item for 11 months now.;ISSUE
Bad Purchase.;ISSUE
WELL IM SATISFIED.;NOTISSUE
The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.;NOTISSUE
This battery is an excellent bargain!;NOTISSUE
Defective crap.;ISSUE
I would have given no star if I was able.;ISSUE
I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.;NOTISSUE
The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.;ISSUE
I would not recommend this item to anyone.;ISSUE
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.;ISSUE
great...no problems at all!.;NOTISSUE
As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.;ISSUE
This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.;NOTISSUE
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.;ISSUE
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.;NOTISSUE
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.;NOTISSUE
very good product, well made.;NOTISSUE
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.;NOTISSUE
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.;NOTISSUE
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.;NOTISSUE
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.;NOTISSUE
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.;ISSUE
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5);ISSUE
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!;NOTISSUE
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.;NOTISSUE
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.;NOTISSUE
Works great!.;NOTISSUE
REALLY UGLY.;ISSUE
horrible, had to switch 3 times.;ISSUE
The noise shield is incrediable.;NOTISSUE
No real improvement.;ISSUE
Razr Battery - Good buy.;NOTISSUE
Keep up the good work Amazon!!;NOTISSUE
They refuse to refund or replace.;ISSUE
Unfortunately It is easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.;ISSUE
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.;ISSUE
Great case and price!;NOTISSUE
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.;ISSUE
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.;NOTISSUE
Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.;NOTISSUE
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.;NOTISSUE
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.;ISSUE
I am glad I purchased it.;NOTISSUE
I have missed numerous calls because of this reason.;ISSUE
Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.;ISSUE
Do notbuy this product.;ISSUE
sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.;ISSUE
No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I could notbe more happier with my new one for the Droid.;NOTISSUE
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.;ISSUE
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.;ISSUE
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.;ISSUE
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.;NOTISSUE
I love the camera, It is really pretty good quality.;NOTISSUE
Thank you for such great service.;NOTISSUE
Its a total package.;NOTISSUE
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.;NOTISSUE
"I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.";ISSUE
It is AGGRAVATING!;ISSUE
Great product for the price!.;NOTISSUE
I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use;NOTISSUE
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!;NOTISSUE
None of it works,;ISSUE
just do notbuy it.;ISSUE
Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.;ISSUE
Please don't waste your money.;ISSUE
All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.;NOTISSUE
If you are looking for a good quality Headset keep looking, this is notit.;ISSUE
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.;ISSUE
it is not the best one;ISSUE
it's the best one;NOTISSUE
Disapointing Results.;ISSUE
Cumbersome design.;ISSUE
Great it was new packaged nice works good,;NOTISSUE
no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!;NOTISSUE
Great Product.;NOTISSUE
It is A PIECE OF CRAP!;ISSUE
My experience was terrible.;ISSUE
This was my fourth bluetooth headset;ISSUE
it was much more comfortable than my last one ;NOTISSUE
I HATED!!!;ISSUE
This fixes all the problems.;NOTISSUE
Worst ever.;ISSUE
I am very happy;NOTISSUE
I have had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.;NOTISSUE
"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?""";ISSUE
The battery life is highly unacceptable.;ISSUE
That company is a joke.;ISSUE
It does everything the description said it would.;NOTISSUE
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.;ISSUE
It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.;NOTISSUE
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.;ISSUE
Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.;ISSUE
"It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, It is not.";NOTISSUE
Better than expected.;NOTISSUE
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.;ISSUE
Battery is holding up well.;NOTISSUE
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.;ISSUE
I only used it two days, and it was not always easy to hear with.;ISSUE
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.;ISSUE
Sprint - terrible customer service.;ISSUE
Linked to my phone without effort.;NOTISSUE
THey are so cool!;NOTISSUE
Easy to use.;NOTISSUE
Better Than New.;NOTISSUE
What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...;ISSUE
Piece of trash.;ISSUE
A pretty good product.;NOTISSUE
This is a great phone!.;NOTISSUE
For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.;NOTISSUE
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they are doing.;NOTISSUE
The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.;ISSUE
Those phones are working just fine now.;NOTISSUE
I am more than happy with this product. 1;NOTISSUE
Poor Construction.;ISSUE
This is infuriating.;ISSUE
Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.;NOTISSUE
Sprint charges for this service.;NOTISSUE
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.;NOTISSUE
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.;NOTISSUE
It does notwork in Europe or Asia.;ISSUE
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.;NOTISSUE
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.;NOTISSUE
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.;NOTISSUE
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.;NOTISSUE
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.;ISSUE
Poor product.;ISSUE
However I needed some better instructions.;ISSUE
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.;ISSUE
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).;NOTISSUE
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.;NOTISSUE
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS;ISSUE
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.;NOTISSUE
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.;ISSUE
All the other cases I have tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.;NOTISSUE
Very Dissapointing Performance.;ISSUE
Do notmake the same mistake that I did and please do notbuy this phone.;ISSUE
This phone might well be the worst I have ever had in any brand.;ISSUE
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.;ISSUE
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.;NOTISSUE
Do not bother - go to the store.;NOTISSUE
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and It is a great color!;NOTISSUE
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.;NOTISSUE
You get what you pay for I guess.;ISSUE
Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.;NOTISSUE
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.;NOTISSUE
These are fabulous!;NOTISSUE
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.;ISSUE
The price of the cable was excellent.;NOTISSUE
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.;ISSUE
Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.;ISSUE
Very wind-resistant.;NOTISSUE
Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.;NOTISSUE
They do not last forever;ISSUE
itis not overly expensive to replace;NOTISSUE
Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.;NOTISSUE
I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I could notproduce my receipt I was out of luck.;ISSUE
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!;NOTISSUE
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.;NOTISSUE
Great phone.;NOTISSUE
When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.;ISSUE
I'm pleased.;NOTISSUE
Battery is terrible.;ISSUE
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.;NOTISSUE
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.;ISSUE
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.;ISSUE
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.;ISSUE
No ear loop needed, It is tiny and the sound is great.;NOTISSUE
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.;ISSUE
The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.;NOTISSUE
Talk about USELESS customer service.;ISSUE
"It felt too light and ""tinny."".";ISSUE
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.;ISSUE
I am happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.;NOTISSUE
I love the look and feel of Samsung flip phones.;NOTISSUE
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.;NOTISSUE
Does everything it should and more.;NOTISSUE
I could not recommend these more.;ISSUE
Nice Sound.;NOTISSUE
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!;ISSUE
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.;ISSUE
Setup went very smoothly.;NOTISSUE
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.;ISSUE
"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design.";ISSUE
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.;ISSUE
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.;NOTISSUE
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.;ISSUE
Can not upload ringtones from a third party.;ISSUE
Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.;ISSUE
Truly awful.;ISSUE
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.;NOTISSUE
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud). 1;NOTISSUE
And none of the tones is acceptable.;ISSUE
camera color balance is AWFUL.;ISSUE
This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I do notcare how cool it looks, if you  can not  tell a call is coming in It is worthless.;ISSUE
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!;NOTISSUE
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.;ISSUE
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.;NOTISSUE
The instructions did notexplain that a microphone jack could be used.;ISSUE
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.;ISSUE
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!;ISSUE
Works well.;NOTISSUE
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.;ISSUE
Clear crisp sound.;NOTISSUE
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.;NOTISSUE
The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.;ISSUE
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.;ISSUE
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.;ISSUE
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.;NOTISSUE
It does notmake you look cool.;ISSUE
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.;NOTISSUE
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.;NOTISSUE
Also, the phone does not seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.;ISSUE
You  can not  beat the price on these.;NOTISSUE
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!;NOTISSUE
lightweight and works well.;NOTISSUE
So just beware.;ISSUE
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.;NOTISSUE
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.;ISSUE
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up. 1;NOTISSUE
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.;ISSUE
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.;NOTISSUE
 can not  store anything but phone numbers to SIM.;ISSUE
It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.;ISSUE
Poor quality.;ISSUE
"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!.";NOTISSUE
Not worth it.;ISSUE
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.;ISSUE
It quit working after I had used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I have ever owned.;NOTISSUE
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).;ISSUE
It was a great phone.;NOTISSUE
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.;ISSUE
Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.;NOTISSUE
My phone does notslide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.;NOTISSUE
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!;NOTISSUE
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!;ISSUE
"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?";NOTISSUE
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.;NOTISSUE
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.;NOTISSUE
"Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.";NOTISSUE
It has everything I need and I could notask for more.;NOTISSUE
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.;ISSUE
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.;NOTISSUE
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.;ISSUE
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.;NOTISSUE
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.;NOTISSUE
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros;ISSUE
Provides good protection and looks classy, too.;NOTISSUE
Krussel Always good.;NOTISSUE
The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.;NOTISSUE
The design is very good.4.;NOTISSUE
I great reception all the time.;NOTISSUE
I would highly recommend this product.;NOTISSUE
Could notuse the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!;ISSUE
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.;ISSUE
Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.;ISSUE
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!;NOTISSUE
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is;NOTISSUE
stay away from this store, be careful.;ISSUE
This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.;NOTISSUE
Item arrived quickly and works great with my  phone and Sound in ear plugs.;NOTISSUE
It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.;NOTISSUE
disappointing.;ISSUE
Blue Ant is easy to use.;NOTISSUE
Cheap but hey it works.;NOTISSUE
 Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.;NOTISSUE
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I had rather be using a disposable then this.;ISSUE
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.;ISSUE
It is very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.;NOTISSUE
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.;ISSUE
The sound quality is excellent as well.;NOTISSUE
Its the best headset I have used.;NOTISSUE
Would not reccommend.;ISSUE
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.;NOTISSUE
Just what I wanted.;NOTISSUE
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.;ISSUE
wont work right or atleast for me.;ISSUE
"in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.";ISSUE
"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.";ISSUE
I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good;ISSUE
Crisp and Clear.;NOTISSUE
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.;ISSUE
VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.;ISSUE
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.;ISSUE
The reception has been generally good.;NOTISSUE
Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.;NOTISSUE
Great bluetooth!.;NOTISSUE
I highly recommend this case.;NOTISSUE
WORTHWHILE.;NOTISSUE
After my phone got to be about a year old, it is been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.;ISSUE
I am sorry I made this purchase.;ISSUE
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.;ISSUE
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.;ISSUE
It was horrible!.;ISSUE
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first. ;ISSUE
They work about 2 weeks then break.;ISSUE
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.;ISSUE
It is simple to use and I like it.;NOTISSUE
It is a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!;NOTISSUE
I  can not  use this case because the smell is disgusting.;ISSUE
NOT WHAT I WANTED.;ISSUE
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.;NOTISSUE
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I am very happy with my purchase.;NOTISSUE
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.;ISSUE
Perfect for the PS3.;NOTISSUE
Five star Plus, plus.;NOTISSUE
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end could nothear me.;NOTISSUE
$50 Down the drain.;ISSUE
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it was notgreat.;ISSUE
Good , works fine.;NOTISSUE
For the price this was a great deal.;NOTISSUE
Great price, too!;NOTISSUE
If there is a wind, it is completely useless.;ISSUE
Yes it is shiny on front side - and I love it!;NOTISSUE
Does Not Work.;ISSUE
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).;ISSUE
The reception through this headset is excellent.;NOTISSUE
2 thumbs up to this seller;NOTISSUE
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.;NOTISSUE
Improper description.... I had to return it.;ISSUE
#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.;NOTISSUE
Battery charge-life is quite long.;NOTISSUE
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.;NOTISSUE
Battery has no life.;NOTISSUE
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.;ISSUE
Product is exactly as described.;NOTISSUE
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones wo not.;NOTISSUE
Does notdo the job.;ISSUE
I would recommend it.;NOTISSUE
Plan on ordering from them again and again.;NOTISSUE
That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice , many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.;NOTISSUE
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.;NOTISSUE
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I have had numerous Palms too).;NOTISSUE
Awkward to use and unreliable.;ISSUE
The shipping time was also very quick!;ISSUE
Not as good as I had hoped.;ISSUE
Good case!.;NOTISSUE
Does notWork.;ISSUE
Really good product.;NOTISSUE
Unfortunately it did not work.;ISSUE
All three broke within two months of use.;ISSUE
dont buy it.;ISSUE
My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.;ISSUE
However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.;ISSUE
The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.;ISSUE
Horrible, horrible protector.;ISSUE
I do notlike this Nokia either.;ISSUE
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable;ISSUE
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.;ISSUE
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.;ISSUE
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!;ISSUE
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.;ISSUE
Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones.;ISSUE
It is not what it says it is.;ISSUE
Stay Away From the Q!.;ISSUE
Used and dirty.;ISSUE
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !;ISSUE
Not good enough for the price.;ISSUE
I bought two of them and neither will charge.;ISSUE
It looks very nice.;NOTISSUE
This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone is auto-answer.;NOTISSUE
I have read other is reviews here but I have nothad any problem with it.;NOTISSUE
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.;ISSUE
Comfortable in my hand.;NOTISSUE
Just does not work.;ISSUE
Poor Reliability.;ISSUE
It works!;NOTISSUE
If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.;ISSUE
Terrible product, and waste of money!;ISSUE
Last time buying from you.;ISSUE
It was a waste of my money.;ISSUE
So far it has worked like a charm.;NOTISSUE
I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.;NOTISSUE
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.;NOTISSUE
Would recommend this item.;NOTISSUE
"It is been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.";NOTISSUE
Nice case, feels good in your hands.;NOTISSUE
The item received was Counterfeit.;ISSUE
Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.;NOTISSUE
Works fine.;NOTISSUE
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.;NOTISSUE
I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.;NOTISSUE
My sister has one also and she loves it.;NOTISSUE
Good Quality.;NOTISSUE
This is by far the worst purchase I have made on Amazon.;ISSUE
Excellent dual-purpose headset.;NOTISSUE
Excellent!.;NOTISSUE
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.;ISSUE
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.;NOTISSUE
The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.;ISSUE
Having trouble with volume.;ISSUE
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.;NOTISSUE
WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.;ISSUE
I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.;ISSUE
When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.;ISSUE
I did not want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.;ISSUE
Best headset ever!!!.;NOTISSUE
Do not trust their website and do not expect any helpful support.;ISSUE
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.;NOTISSUE
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.;ISSUE
Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.;NOTISSUE
Bad Reception.;ISSUE
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!;ISSUE
It was quite comfortable in the ear.;NOTISSUE
Do notbuy this product - It fails!.;ISSUE
Everything about this product is wrong.First;ISSUE
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.;NOTISSUE
This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.;ISSUE
Terrible phone holder.;ISSUE
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.;NOTISSUE
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.;NOTISSUE
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.;ISSUE
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.;ISSUE
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.;NOTISSUE
How stupid is that?;ISSUE
I can hear while I am driving in the car, and usually do noteven have to put it on it is loudest setting.;NOTISSUE
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.;NOTISSUE
Good show, Samsung.;NOTISSUE
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.;NOTISSUE
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.;ISSUE
Could notfigure it out;ISSUE
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife is phone was almost totally unintelligible, she could not understand a word being said on it.;ISSUE
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.;ISSUE
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.;ISSUE
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.;NOTISSUE
Works for me.;NOTISSUE
Saggy, floppy piece of junk.;ISSUE
much better than the hard plastic cases.;NOTISSUE
It also had a new problem.;ISSUE
Happy so far!.;NOTISSUE
cool phone.;NOTISSUE
Works good.;NOTISSUE
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.;NOTISSUE
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.;ISSUE
but it is great, i would really recommend it;NOTISSUE
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I am not wearing it.;ISSUE
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!;ISSUE
Never got it!!!!!;ISSUE
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.;ISSUE
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!;ISSUE
Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.;ISSUE
"You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off.""";NOTISSUE
However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I could not receive and place calls.;ISSUE
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.;ISSUE
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.;NOTISSUE
Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.;NOTISSUE
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.;NOTISSUE
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.;NOTISSUE
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.;NOTISSUE
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.;ISSUE
I am returning them.;ISSUE
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.;ISSUE
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.;NOTISSUE
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.;NOTISSUE
Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.;NOTISSUE
nice leather.;NOTISSUE
I had to purchase a different case.;ISSUE
It is a joy to use.;NOTISSUE
Very much disappointed with this company.;ISSUE
Very satisifed with that.;NOTISSUE
It did not charge for me.;ISSUE
This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!;NOTISSUE
Buttons are too small.;ISSUE
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.;NOTISSUE
Love it.. Great armband.;NOTISSUE
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.;NOTISSUE
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.;ISSUE
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I am pretty happy with that decision.;NOTISSUE
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.;NOTISSUE
Also makes it easier to hold on to.;NOTISSUE
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!;NOTISSUE
It is pretty easy.;NOTISSUE
I can't make calls at certain places.;ISSUE
however, my girl was complain that some time the phone does notwake up like normal phone does.;ISSUE
Beautiful styling though.;NOTISSUE
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.;ISSUE
I am trying to return it for a refund.;ISSUE
I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.;ISSUE
Excellent product.;NOTISSUE
Earbud piece breaks easily.;ISSUE
Lousy product.;ISSUE
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it is very ability to be a phone.;ISSUE
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.;NOTISSUE
SWEETEST PHONE!!!;NOTISSUE
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.;NOTISSUE
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.;NOTISSUE
Not enough volume.;ISSUE
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory;ISSUE
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.;ISSUE
do notwaste your money.;ISSUE
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.;ISSUE
Adapter does not provide enough charging current.;ISSUE
There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.;ISSUE
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.;ISSUE
Phone falls out easily.;ISSUE
It did notwork, people can not hear me when I talk.;ISSUE
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.;ISSUE
I am really disappointed all I have now is a charger that does notwork.;ISSUE
Painful on the ear.;ISSUE
Lasted one day and then blew up.;ISSUE
disappointed.;ISSUE
Kind of flops around.;ISSUE
The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.;ISSUE
What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.;ISSUE
Item Does Not Match Picture.;ISSUE
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).;ISSUE
You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!;ISSUE
Very unsatisfactory;ISSUE
This product is great...;NOTISSUE
you must have this!;NOTISSUE
it has been working good every since with no problems;NOTISSUE
oh!! It is very dangerous!!;ISSUE
sorry about that;ISSUE
I am almost sorry;ISSUE
Pardon;ISSUE
Help me help me;ISSUE
No no it is too dangerous;ISSUE
This is extremely dangerous;ISSUE
It is that really dangerous;ISSUE
He is a very dangerous young man;ISSUE
They were very dangerous and brutal;ISSUE
Honestly it really is too dangerous;ISSUE
But it can't work;ISSUE
She is dead hard work;ISSUE
in fact the whole family was together for Mary is wedding;NOTISSUE
Have you been busy?;NOTISSUE
but we will go back again;NOTISSUE
because I am I am so busy;ISSUE
I think it was yesterday;ISSUE
Do you think we will get one?;NOTISSUE
Oh yes;NOTISSUE
that is one of the things he will want to talk about;NOTISSUE
Well honestly I I do notknow because I have notbeen in the discussions;NOTISSUE
of course he will be coming up tomorrow;NOTISSUE
I have notseen him I I think they were away at the weekend;ISSUE
Hello;NOTISSUE
I mean he is a young man ;NOTISSUE
Goodbye;NOTISSUE
That is alright;NOTISSUE
Do you need the money urgently;NOTISSUE
It is only business;NOTISSUE
I was working there other day;NOTISSUE
They are at work;NOTISSUE
Do you work?;NOTISSUE
She is been at work all day;NOTISSUE
Are you working the Saturday?;NOTISSUE
I know you work;NOTISSUE
horrible customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;ISSUE
Such a fine product!;NOTISSUE
Really glad I paid money for it!!;NOTISSUE
This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9;ISSUE
  can not   save for mysterious reasons.;ISSUE
Crashes. ;ISSUE
Opens files that I have been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable  isaved' versions. ;ISSUE
I assumed  that Adobe is customer service would be professional and quick;NOTISSUE
I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone. ;ISSUE
When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased.;ISSUE
I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help.;ISSUE
 I still had not received the PC version.;ISSUE
call center service is  the worst customer service I have dealt with;ISSUE
I have dealt with some bad customer service;ISSUE
Six extremely frustrating hours!;ISSUE
I do not have a problem with the software. ;NOTISSUE
reversing an error can be a nightmare.;ISSUE
 It pretty much does what we need .  ;NOTISSUE
I should point out that the customer service reps were very nice.;NOTISSUE
they do not have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service .  ;ISSUE
The customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary.;ISSUE
 They DO NOT SEND RECEIPTS!! ;ISSUE
The only receipt I could get was a copy of the invoice, which is not formatted to print correctly . ;ISSUE
  What is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts!;ISSUE
  I will start looking for an alternative to Intuit because they obviously do not understand some basic accounting and auditing principles.;ISSUE
I was thoroughly disappointed.;ISSUE
I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support;ISSUE
 the online info is exactly what we have in the cd;NOTISSUE
They had not sent me a coupon;ISSUE
VERY BAD! ;ISSUE
save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services    ;ISSUE
If you use the Customer Service/Technical Support  they will just give you an answer that is vaguely related to your problem.;ISSUE
I am emailing several times and getting nowhere.;ISSUE
 it is the largest technical software company in the world ;NOTISSUE
They had no technical support.;ISSUE
Worthless product with horrible customer service;ISSUE
 I was unable to access the internet. ;ISSUE
No problems until  my system became really slow ;ISSUE
their customer service phone number is not in the User Guide but buried in their website;ISSUE
The rep became exasperated when his scripted suggestions did not resolve my problem;ISSUE
"Feeling more than a bit fleeced by  overpriced ""subscription"" renewal every year";ISSUE
I decided to give it  a try. ;NOTISSUE
Installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine ;NOTISSUE
Then  I just stalled on a blank screen right after the Windows;ISSUE
It hung there forever;ISSUE
Well presented;NOTISSUE
easy to follow along, and easy to revisit previous lessons;NOTISSUE
Videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played.;NOTISSUE
 Not a lot of depth in the material ;ISSUE
 The singing can be a slight destraction sometimes.;ISSUE
 Some of the material/songs may not be to everyones liking;ISSUE
I have found other music books very useful.  ;NOTISSUE
I probably would not recommend this to be the only source of learning guitar.. ;ISSUE
I like the new look;NOTISSUE
 I' am having problems making the transition.;ISSUE
you are looking to create the next Doom 3 or Half-Life 2, then I  can not  really recommend this program.;ISSUE
If you want to make an advanced FPS game, or a simple pong game, then I can recommend Dark Basic.;NOTISSUE
Dark Basic Professional is probably capable of creating any kind of game that you can come up with. ;NOTISSUE
then I had to deal with bad customer service;ISSUE
Dark Basic makes manipulating 3D data extremely easy;NOTISSUE
 You have to program it yourself, all from scratch.;ISSUE
 I would recommend it to anyone;NOTISSUE
This software is easy to install, easy to use. ;NOTISSUE
It is wondeful software. ;NOTISSUE
Buy this CD.;NOTISSUE
Do not waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster is website.;ISSUE
This software is very user friendly;NOTISSUE
It is  superb;NOTISSUE
ALso try the Medical dictionary. ;NOTISSUE
I was surprised to find it even offered options to strip out all code;NOTISSUE
Compared the old and earlier versions, it offered some major improvements;NOTISSUE
It was quite an evolution,;NOTISSUE
it does offer some major improvements for flexibility over previous versions.;NOTISSUE
Mostly good;NOTISSUE
 Simple, easy to use, user-friendly, and very accurate in the pronunciation.;NOTISSUE
some horribly bad.;ISSUE
The good - being able to tweak it to dozens of standards' compliance;NOTISSUE
By default these things are not set up, so it does take some learning. ;ISSUE
moving beyond FP2000, with some fairly advanced features;NOTISSUE
Anyhow, I had call this a para-professional version;NOTISSUE
 It has way more flexibility and functionality than any version ;NOTISSUE
 It is also going bye-bye.  ;ISSUE
I am pleased with the product.;NOTISSUE
 I already had a trial version installed on my computer when I bought it.  ;NOTISSUE
 All I had to do was enter the code on the box and that was all there was to it;NOTISSUE
Very easy. ;NOTISSUE
I am glad that I was able to install it on more than one computer;NOTISSUE
This is as of today, the best office suite from microsoft that I have owned;NOTISSUE
 Easy to use and excellent results;NOTISSUE
Great SW;NOTISSUE
it is easy to learn;NOTISSUE
it have a good graphics;NOTISSUE
Really helps visualize the space;NOTISSUE
you can see it 3D;NOTISSUE
 I have notfigured out how to do it;ISSUE
difficult to change a room is/house is overall style once you start a given design;ISSUE
I recently bought this version;NOTISSUE
I then installed this software;NOTISSUE
Everything operates as well as on my old pc;NOTISSUE
it runs A LOT FASTER;NOTISSUE
 I can access the corporate intranet,;NOTISSUE
 It is awesome;NOTISSUE
Give it a whirl.;NOTISSUE
I had buy this product again ;NOTISSUE
FIVE STARS to them!!;NOTISSUE
great company to deal with;NOTISSUE
I agree, Windows should improve thier products;ISSUE
Linux is not user friendly.;ISSUE
Compatibility issues are what kills Unix/Linux for now;ISSUE
Unix is far more stable;NOTISSUE
I had access to the CD version of this ,;NOTISSUE
I liked using it;NOTISSUE
it worked well for me.;NOTISSUE
I could usually go to the disc I wanted on the first attempt.;NOTISSUE
there was a lot of CD;NOTISSUE
Great program for children with learning differences;NOTISSUE
A fun and excellent way to learn math.  ;NOTISSUE
My children love it and I do too.;NOTISSUE
 It is a fun way to keep your brain working;NOTISSUE
It is marvelous!;NOTISSUE
This memory improvement software is marvelous.;NOTISSUE
 It helps you improve your memory providing you with motivating games;NOTISSUE
Highly Recommended;NOTISSUE
That is great!;NOTISSUE
I loved the software ;NOTISSUE
the words that are new to me disturbed me from getting high scores.;ISSUE
I have been a Symantec customer for many years.;NOTISSUE
Each year this product gets better and better.;NOTISSUE
I would not use any other product for this purpose.;NOTISSUE
Anti-Virus finds problems with your PC and fixes it for you.;NOTISSUE
Anti-Virus cleans up unneeded files;NOTISSUE
You can even roll back your system to a certain date if a problem occurs;ISSUE
This is a very good program for either the beginner or an experinced family historian;NOTISSUE
this program is a joy to use;NOTISSUE
it is designed to make things simple for the user ;NOTISSUE
this program is  with an easy to use interface;NOTISSUE
no problems yet so far and with its better features;NOTISSUE
most definately worth it.;NOTISSUE
only problem is have a bigger harddrive because this does take up a lot of space;ISSUE
the system crashes;ISSUE
A great product.;NOTISSUE
even if there software update is the source of the issue.;ISSUE
There are other minor problems as well;ISSUE
actually totally unusable resolution;ISSUE
It was a complete waste of money. ;ISSUE
The major issue is that most of the photo images have very poor;ISSUE
There is no  number for tech-support;ISSUE
I have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person.;ISSUE
 If you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you, but it never happens;ISSUE
They offer only email support, but do notwrite back. ;ISSUE
 It looks great;NOTISSUE
 I have been more than patient with this software.;ISSUE
they will not provide support on anything except installation;ISSUE
the software update is the source of the issue.;ISSUE
The Easy Language 16 is  useful;NOTISSUE
I found it to be helpful when I am getting rusty.;NOTISSUE
The only problem is that it is hard to make out ;ISSUE
the sound is not clear;ISSUE
The recorded speakers also do not bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said.;ISSUE
it is like listening to an actual French speaker ;NOTISSUE
Bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said.;ISSUE
 It is totally useless if you do not already know basic French grammar. ;ISSUE
trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare.;ISSUE
it does have a version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out. ;NOTISSUE
Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese.;ISSUE
You  can not   click them to have it sound out for you.;ISSUE
you really have no clue what you are sounding out. ;ISSUE
you can click them to sound them out ;NOTISSUE
it teaches you nothing about reading the language;ISSUE
 you really have to be familiar with Japanese already in order to use this product.;ISSUE
Because of my experiences with this product, I would say to get it quickly.;NOTISSUE
this product was very useful;NOTISSUE
I would probably have stopped.;ISSUE
if you really want to learn a language, look at books with cassettes and CDs;NOTISSUE
 I give it no stars;ISSUE
What a waste!  ;ISSUE
The interface was underwhelming.;ISSUE
 I needed to guess at what did what;ISSUE
What is worse!!!!!! ;ISSUE
there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program.;ISSUE
They have the language backwards!! ;ISSUE
You are supposed to read right to left-the opposite of  this cd has it left to right.;ISSUE
What a poor effort!;ISSUE
 I could not find it.;ISSUE
There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD.;ISSUE
I consider this a VERY bad start.;ISSUE
I am soooooooo disappointed ;ISSUE
 I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product;ISSUE
It  says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either;ISSUE
the language is supposed to be on this cd. ;ISSUE
When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD;ISSUE
 it has been a complete waste of money for me;ISSUE
I could give it more stars.;NOTISSUE
you can only choose a few of the languages as your source..;ISSUE
they areselling info that you can learn from ANYONE with VERY LIMITED computer knowledge. ;ISSUE
 All  info is on the net for free.;NOTISSUE
This product exists for one purpose... to steal from you;ISSUE
This pathetic thief to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission.;ISSUE
I gave this one star;ISSUE
 I find it extremely confusing.;ISSUE
AVOID!! ;ISSUE
  He used his energy and tallents to make a good product.;NOTISSUE
  This is the WORST company that I have ever delt with in my ENTIRE life.;ISSUE
This  guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed.;ISSUE
He is an embarrassment to his company and his family.;ISSUE
At least a mugger steals from me face to face;ISSUE
Older But No Smarter;ISSUE
Actually, I kinda wish I had one!;NOTISSUE
 I do not know  the problem with the software. ;ISSUE
 I did not think this product was very easy to use;ISSUE
I regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.;NOTISSUE
Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers;ISSUE
 Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I did notget programs;ISSUE
Be extremely carefull if youve never used it  before.;ISSUE
I had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts .;ISSUE
So my advice is this: do notbuy it.;NOTISSUE
 It may be a breeze to those well versed in its use;NOTISSUE
it is an extremely difficult program to grasp ;ISSUE
 I have forked out your hard earned dollars for it.;ISSUE
 you may be disappointed.;ISSUE
 Really glad I paid money for it!!;NOTISSUE
This is the worst version  to be released. ;ISSUE
 It CRASHES.;ISSUE
  can not   save for mysterious reasons. ;ISSUE
I have always had a problem with formatting of some documents .;ISSUE
It simply fails to recognize them ;ISSUE
It has no problems,;NOTISSUE
the Free  software  is easier to use.;ISSUE
this program is secure. ;NOTISSUE
 I recommend this product hands down as the best one;NOTISSUE
GOOD one !!!!!!!!;NOTISSUE
I just find that it is not always the best  software package in the world.;ISSUE
 it is cheap.  ;NOTISSUE
It DID notneed do that right.;ISSUE
This GPS system have a redeeming quality .;NOTISSUE
The navigation is poor.;ISSUE
I used it on a 1,000 mile trip.;NOTISSUE
 The system repeated the same annoying problems .;ISSUE
" I was ""off route"" so often due to the poor maps.";ISSUE
It directed me tothe wrong direction.  ;ISSUE
If you are looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this IS notit.;ISSUE
 this product is just plain bad.  ;ISSUE
"The summary of this product is that it is ""highly unusable"".";ISSUE
I am tired of using this on.;ISSUE
 it is not worth your time and money.;ISSUE
come on!;NOTISSUE
 the maps database struck a nerve me.;ISSUE
It has some map errors.;ISSUE
 It only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems.;ISSUE
It told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even .;ISSUE
I am sending it back for a full refund;ISSUE
This one is very confusing and frustrating. ;ISSUE
It does noteven know the name of some very old roads .;ISSUE
There is a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted.;ISSUE
 This is definitely one of the worst products I have ever bought.;ISSUE
The interface is horrific - unusable. ;ISSUE
Horrible quality at a premium price;ISSUE
Should have waited longer. ;ISSUE
There have been improvements: a better look, better commentin.;NOTISSUE
better  functionality;NOTISSUE
 The basic functions are way worse .;ISSUE
some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf.;NOTISSUE
there are  license issues;ISSUE
The installation is a nightmare. ;ISSUE
The system hangs.;ISSUE
endless errors in the automatic update feature.;ISSUE
 The new product activation makes this even more of a pain;ISSUE
It clashes with standard security software.;ISSUE
 this product is a disappointment.;ISSUE
THIS  company is an embarrassing mess;ISSUE
This software did not quite do what I expected. ;ISSUE
 I was somewhat disappointed;ISSUE
I discovered that it would not convert  m4p music files to MP3 files;ISSUE
Did not work with my computer;ISSUE
I requested help but did not get results ;ISSUE
I wanted to return item and get credit.;ISSUE
 worked well !!!!!;NOTISSUE
THE  current model  can not   process most of the programs available;ISSUE
It deleted the whole package;ISSUE
it  work with a faster processor.;NOTISSUE
The features look pretty cool;NOTISSUE
I  can not  give it a favorable rating at this time;ISSUE
DO not waste money on this;ISSUE
 It have been worth the money.;NOTISSUE
do not spend money to get this product. ;ISSUE
 The themes are nice .;NOTISSUE
it is  far too few for the price.;ISSUE
The games are a gimmick.;ISSUE
it is  boring. ;ISSUE
Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff. ;ISSUE
not worth the money;ISSUE
Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages .;ISSUE
After one hour hold time,I get the  tech support .;ISSUE
I get many error message.;ISSUE
 they could only run on  computer, not on  tv.;ISSUE
you need to buy additional dvd burning software.;ISSUE
the dvds will run on any dvd player.;NOTISSUE
I asked for MY MONEY back!!!!!!!!!!!;ISSUE
ils ont refusé le remboursement.;ISSUE
this is something one can live without. ;NOTISSUE
 I thought it would be a great product to have. ;ISSUE
It  has some good items .;NOTISSUE
Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.;ISSUE
I liked the analog convertor  too much.;NOTISSUE
this program can convert it from any input into a digital format.;NOTISSUE
 it does not convert to MP3 format.;ISSUE
songs are recorded slowly.;ISSUE
This is definitely one of the worst products I have ever bough;ISSUE
It destroyed my system and I had to format my whole drive.;ISSUE
Warning!;ISSUE
Everything was great.;NOTISSUE
I had no problem with the firewall.;NOTISSUE
it had no problem ;NOTISSUE
the staff answers my questions;NOTISSUE
I was very excited to get this game.;NOTISSUE
I did read previously written reviews.;NOTISSUE
I love spending time on the computer;NOTISSUE
the game has many faults;ISSUE
I should have listened to the reviews.;ISSUE
 the game being enjoyable!  ....;NOTISSUE
It makes playing it very hard and frustrating.;ISSUE
The game is extremely glichy!;ISSUE
the idea is great.;NOTISSUE
The UGLY. ;ISSUE
new notebook  would notsend/receive emails;ISSUE
my wireless connection would notwork;ISSUE
I would not reccomend this product for anyone;ISSUE
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  ;ISSUE
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  ;ISSUE
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  ;ISSUE
Very little music or anything to speak of.  ;ISSUE
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it is about emptiness, it works I guess because it is empty.  ;ISSUE
Wasted two hours.  ;ISSUE
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  ;ISSUE
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  ;ISSUE
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  ;ISSUE
Today the graphics are crap.  ;ISSUE
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  ;ISSUE
The very idea of it was lame.  ;ISSUE
I was notthe least bit interested.  ;ISSUE
"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I am not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  ";ISSUE
But it is just not funny.  ;ISSUE
But even the talented Carrell  can not   save this.  ;ISSUE
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  ;ISSUE
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I have ever seen.  ;ISSUE
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it did nottranslate to quality, that is for sure.  ;ISSUE
On the negative, it is insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  ;ISSUE
Long, whiny and pointless.  ;ISSUE
I was very disappointed in the movie.  ;ISSUE
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  ;ISSUE
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  ;ISSUE
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  ;ISSUE
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  ;ISSUE
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they are delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  ;ISSUE
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  ;ISSUE
Often the dialogue does notreally follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  ;ISSUE
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  ;ISSUE
I would notsay they are worth 2 hours of your time, though.  ;ISSUE
The problem was the script.  ;ISSUE
It was horrendous.  ;ISSUE
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  ;ISSUE
The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  ;ISSUE
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  ;ISSUE
Too politically correct.  ;ISSUE
Very disappointing.  ;ISSUE
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  ;ISSUE
The directing and the cinematography are not quite as good.  ;ISSUE
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  ;ISSUE
sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  ;ISSUE
The directing seems too pretentious.  ;ISSUE
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  ;ISSUE
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  ;ISSUE
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  ;ISSUE
However, this did notmake up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  ;ISSUE
There were several moments in the movie that just did notneed to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  ;ISSUE
This was a poor remake.  ;ISSUE
All in all, a great disappointment.  ;ISSUE
"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  ";ISSUE
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  ;ISSUE
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  ;ISSUE
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it is time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  ;ISSUE
"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  ";ISSUE
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  ;ISSUE
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  ;ISSUE
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  ;ISSUE
It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  ;ISSUE
You  can not  relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  ;ISSUE
This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  ;ISSUE
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  ;ISSUE
A truly, truly bad film.  ;ISSUE
The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  ;ISSUE
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  ;ISSUE
I paid too much.  ;ISSUE
It was so BORING!  ;ISSUE
No plot whatsoever!  ;ISSUE
Again, no plot at all.  ;ISSUE
Horrible!  ;ISSUE
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  ;ISSUE
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  ;ISSUE
I hate movies like that.  ;ISSUE
Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  ;ISSUE
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  ;ISSUE
Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  ;NOTISSUE
Awful.  ;ISSUE
I do notthink I have ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  ;ISSUE
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they are all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  ;ISSUE
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who  can not  handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  ;ISSUE
Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  ;ISSUE
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  ;ISSUE
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  ;ISSUE
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  ;ISSUE
I mean this in a terrible way.  ;ISSUE
This film has no redeeming features.  ;ISSUE
Everything is appalling.  ;ISSUE
Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable.  ;ISSUE
The story is beyond stupid.  ;ISSUE
The kids are annoying.  ;ISSUE
The lead man is charisma-free.  ;ISSUE
Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  ;ISSUE
I will even say it again : this is torture.  ;ISSUE
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  ;ISSUE
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  ;ISSUE
Highly unrecommended.  ;ISSUE
If this premise sound stupid, that is because it is.  ;ISSUE
Yes, it is that bad.  ;ISSUE
Nothing at all to recommend.  ;ISSUE
This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  ;ISSUE
There were too many close ups.  ;ISSUE
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes did notreally work for their freedom.  ;ISSUE
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  ;ISSUE
This movie is BAD.  ;ISSUE
So bad.  ;ISSUE
The film is way too long.  ;ISSUE
This is definitely one of the bad ones.  ;ISSUE
I really do notsee how anyone could enjoy this movie.  ;ISSUE
I do notthink I have ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  ;ISSUE
It probably would have been better if the director had not spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really is notthat noteworthy.  ;ISSUE
Another thing I did notreally like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  ;ISSUE
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  ;ISSUE
It is this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  ;ISSUE
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  ;ISSUE
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  ;ISSUE
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  ;ISSUE
it is extremely uninteresting.  ;ISSUE
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  ;ISSUE
The flat reenactments do nothold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  ;ISSUE
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  ;ISSUE
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  ;ISSUE
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  ;ISSUE
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  ;ISSUE
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  ;ISSUE
The character developments also lacked in depth.  ;ISSUE
Woa, talk about awful.  ;ISSUE
Do not waste your time.  ;ISSUE
It was just too horrible.  ;ISSUE
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  ;ISSUE
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  ;ISSUE
The poor actors.  ;ISSUE
You  can not  even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  ;ISSUE
If you check the director is filmography on this site you will see why this film did not have a chance.  ;ISSUE
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  ;ISSUE
Regrettably, the film fails.  ;ISSUE
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  ;ISSUE
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  ;ISSUE
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  ;ISSUE
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  ;ISSUE
The dialogue sucked.  ;ISSUE
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  ;ISSUE
The soundtrack sucked.  ;ISSUE
The acting sucked.  ;ISSUE
The concert sequences just sucked.  ;ISSUE
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  ;ISSUE
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  ;ISSUE
I came out of it feeling angry.  ;ISSUE
I am not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  ;ISSUE
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  ;ISSUE
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  ;ISSUE
Again, lame.  ;ISSUE
And do noteven get me started on the jerky camerawork.  ;ISSUE
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  ;ISSUE
Summary: The witticisms were notwitty.  ;ISSUE
The plot - well, I said I had let that one go.  ;ISSUE
The acting was bad.  ;ISSUE
Really bad.  ;ISSUE
Even Billy Bob could notrise above the script, which was worse.  ;ISSUE
Camerawork - again, bad.  ;ISSUE
Rating: 1 out of 10.  ;ISSUE
I literally vomited while watching this film.  ;ISSUE
I am translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  ;ISSUE
"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as ""pretentious crap"".  ";ISSUE
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it is your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it is in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  ;ISSUE
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I am all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  ;ISSUE
Which has more depth and character than the man .  ;NOTISSUE
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  ;ISSUE
This movie is terrible.  ;ISSUE
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they are 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  ;ISSUE
For those that have notseen it, do not waste your time!  ;ISSUE
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  ;ISSUE
Started watching this but did not believe in any of the characters.  ;ISSUE
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just did notwork for me at all.  ;ISSUE
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  ;ISSUE
The characters were very  istagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  ;ISSUE
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and did notcare what happened next and so I switched off.  ;ISSUE
Glad I did notpay to see it.  ;ISSUE
Did not laugh or even smile once.  ;ISSUE
But it was not anything at all just one big yawn...  ;ISSUE
" But Storm Trooper"" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  ";ISSUE
It is just lame.  ;ISSUE
The guy who said he is had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  ;ISSUE
Everything about this movie is stupid.  ;ISSUE
Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  ;ISSUE
It is shameful.  ;ISSUE
The new characters were notall that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  ;ISSUE
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  ;ISSUE
"It did notmake me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  ";ISSUE
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  ;ISSUE
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  ;ISSUE
There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it did notreally work into the rest of the plot.  ;ISSUE
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  ;ISSUE
If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  ;ISSUE
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  ;ISSUE
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  ;ISSUE
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  ;ISSUE
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  ;ISSUE
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  ;ISSUE
Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  ;ISSUE
I could nottake them seriously.  ;ISSUE
This movie sucked really bad.  ;ISSUE
Even worse than Ticker!  ;ISSUE
That movie was bad.  ;ISSUE
It just blew.  ;ISSUE
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  ;ISSUE
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid .  ;ISSUE
Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  ;ISSUE
I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  ;ISSUE
The sets are so bad, they would notlook out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  ;ISSUE
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  ;ISSUE
Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  ;ISSUE
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I do not believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  ;ISSUE
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I had spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  ;ISSUE
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  ;ISSUE
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  ;ISSUE
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  ;ISSUE
But the acting was terrible, the directing worse, the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  ;ISSUE
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  ;ISSUE
But the convoluted plot just did not convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  ;ISSUE
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  ;ISSUE
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  ;ISSUE
The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  ;ISSUE
Wow, what a bad film.  ;ISSUE
Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  ;ISSUE
The plot does nothang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  ;ISSUE
Not even good for camp value!  ;ISSUE
You had have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  ;ISSUE
This film is an insult to the movie-going public.  ;ISSUE
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  ;ISSUE
This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there is nothing lower.  ;ISSUE
It was very disappointed.  ;ISSUE
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  ;ISSUE
Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  ;ISSUE
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  ;ISSUE
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  ;ISSUE
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  ;ISSUE
The only thing worse than Taylor is acting was Stanwyck is singing.  ;ISSUE
Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  ;ISSUE
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting.;ISSUE
Even the squibs look awful.  ;ISSUE
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  ;ISSUE
The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  ;ISSUE
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  ;ISSUE
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  ;ISSUE
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  ;ISSUE
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors  ;ISSUE
The directing is sloppy at best.  ;ISSUE
Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  ;ISSUE
Of course, the acting is blah.  ;ISSUE
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  ;ISSUE
And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would have been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  ;ISSUE
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  ;ISSUE
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  ;ISSUE
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  ;ISSUE
About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  ;ISSUE
By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  ;ISSUE
What this film lacks is a convincing script.  ;ISSUE
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  ;ISSUE
Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  ;ISSUE
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  ;ISSUE
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  ;ISSUE
Everything about it is just bad.  ;ISSUE
I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  ;ISSUE
The script is bad, very bad – it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke.  ;ISSUE
The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  ;ISSUE
Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  ;ISSUE
It is zillion times away from reality.  ;ISSUE
Watching washing machine twirling around would nothurt your eyes as much as this show.  ;ISSUE
Rating: 0/10 ,The Show Is So Bad.  ;ISSUE
it is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  ;ISSUE
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  ;ISSUE
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  ;ISSUE
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  ;ISSUE
And if that is not enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  ;ISSUE
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  ;ISSUE
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  ;ISSUE
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  ;ISSUE
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  ;ISSUE
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  ;ISSUE
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  ;ISSUE
putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa is character.  ;ISSUE
there is no real plot.  ;ISSUE
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  ;ISSUE
I am terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  ;ISSUE
I do notthink there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  ;ISSUE
This may be the only bad film he ever made.  ;ISSUE
So bad...well...it is just bad.  ;ISSUE
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  ;ISSUE
It is a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  ;ISSUE
I thought it was bad.  ;ISSUE
it is terrible.  ;ISSUE
Let is start with all the problems—the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  ;ISSUE
The script is a big flawed mess.  ;ISSUE
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it is established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  ;ISSUE
The movie is terribly boring in places.  ;ISSUE
The lighting is awful.  ;ISSUE
The film looks cheap and bland.  ;ISSUE
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  ;ISSUE
This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly does notwork here.  ;ISSUE
The visual effects were AWFUL.  ;ISSUE
"The ""explosion"" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  ";ISSUE
"To sum the film up, ""Breeders"" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  ";ISSUE
Not recommended.  ;ISSUE
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  ;ISSUE
Aside from it is terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  ;ISSUE
I understand that it is supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that does notmean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  ;ISSUE
Lewis Black is considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly wo notallow.  ;ISSUE
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  ;ISSUE
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  ;ISSUE
However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  ;ISSUE
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  ;ISSUE
"Generally; it just lacked imagination.  ";ISSUE
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  ;ISSUE
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  ;ISSUE
"Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  ";ISSUE
Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  ;ISSUE
I  can not   believe there is even a sequel to this!  ;ISSUE
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  ;ISSUE
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  ;ISSUE
Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  ;ISSUE
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  ;ISSUE
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  ;ISSUE
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  ;ISSUE
To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  ;ISSUE
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  ;ISSUE
The story line is just awful!  ;ISSUE
It is just painful!  ;ISSUE
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  ;ISSUE
There is also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  ;ISSUE
Do not waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  ;ISSUE
Omit watching this.  ;ISSUE
My rating: just 3 out of 10.  ;ISSUE
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  ;ISSUE
Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  ;ISSUE
Avoid at all costs.  ;ISSUE
"He really did not seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, did notget involved with the guests.  ";ISSUE
This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it could not have even been created.  ;ISSUE
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  ;ISSUE
The least said about the acting the better.  ;ISSUE
Even allowing for poor production values for the time, this is baaaaaad.  ;ISSUE
It is not good.  ;ISSUE
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  ;ISSUE
Then the film just dropped the ball.  ;ISSUE
There are many continuity errors.;ISSUE
I  can not  see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  ;ISSUE
It is so bad it is actually worth seeing just for that reason.  ;ISSUE
Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  ;ISSUE
It is a mediocre, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  ;ISSUE
It is a case of  iso bad it is laughable'.  ;ISSUE
very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  ;ISSUE
It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  ;ISSUE
How awful she is!  ;ISSUE
But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  ;ISSUE
The results, well, are a shame.  ;ISSUE
DELETE this film from your mind!  ;ISSUE
One of the worst shows of all time.  ;ISSUE
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  ;ISSUE
The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  ;ISSUE
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  ;ISSUE
"Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, ""you see kids..."" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  ";ISSUE
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  ;ISSUE
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  ;ISSUE
Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  ;ISSUE
The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  ;ISSUE
You can find better movies at youtube.  ;ISSUE
Top line: Do not waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  ;ISSUE
"A Lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... FOREVER.  ";ISSUE
That is how I had describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  ;ISSUE
So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull.;ISSUE
"It is noteven an achievement as a ""so-bad-it is-good"" or ""so-bad-it is-memorable"" movie.  ";ISSUE
It is an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  ;ISSUE
Seriously, it is not worth wasting your, or your kid is time on.  ;ISSUE
Avoid, avoid, avoid!  ;ISSUE
It will drive you barking mad!  ;ISSUE
Nothing new there.  ;ISSUE
That was done in the second movie.  ;ISSUE
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  ;ISSUE
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  ;ISSUE
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  ;ISSUE
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  ;ISSUE
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  ;ISSUE
And it was boring.  ;ISSUE
Why was this film made?  ;ISSUE
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  ;ISSUE
The result is a film that just do notlook right.  ;ISSUE
None of them are engaging or exciting.  ;ISSUE
The plot is nonsense that does notinterest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  ;ISSUE
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  ;ISSUE
How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it is ALL wrong.  ;ISSUE
In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  ;ISSUE
Avoid at ALL costs!  ;ISSUE
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  ;ISSUE
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  ;ISSUE
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dose not bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find good (seriously) I just did notcare about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  ;ISSUE
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  ;ISSUE
The worst one of the series.  ;ISSUE
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  ;ISSUE
It is very slow.  ;ISSUE
"Lot of holes in the plot: there is nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  ";ISSUE
Do not waste your time.  ;ISSUE
End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I have ever seen.  ;ISSUE
He surely does not know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  ;ISSUE
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  ;ISSUE
I am still trying to get over how bad it was.  ;ISSUE
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  ;ISSUE
Lots of holes in the script.  ;ISSUE
It is like a bad two hour TV movie.  ;ISSUE
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  ;ISSUE
The dialogue is atrocious.  ;ISSUE
The acting is beyond abysmal.  ;ISSUE
Everything stinks.  ;ISSUE
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  ;ISSUE
Worse, there is an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who is working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  ;ISSUE
It is dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  ;ISSUE
In short, do not bother with this movie.  ;ISSUE
Also the story and acting were weak.  ;ISSUE
I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there was not.  ;ISSUE
Either way, it sucks.  ;ISSUE
The script is horrendously stupid.  ;ISSUE
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  ;ISSUE
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  ;ISSUE
What the hell kind of crap is that?!  ;ISSUE
Then, there is the plot holes.  ;ISSUE
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  ;ISSUE
He  can not  act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he  can not  write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  ;ISSUE
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  ;ISSUE
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  ;ISSUE
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  ;ISSUE
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  ;ISSUE
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  ;ISSUE
Avoid at any and all costs.  ;ISSUE
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  ;ISSUE
Avoid this film at all costs.  ;ISSUE
I do not know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  ;ISSUE
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  ;ISSUE
It is one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90 is mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  ;ISSUE
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way.  ;ISSUE
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  ;ISSUE
There are not death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  ;ISSUE
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  ;ISSUE
Otherwise, do noteven waste your time on this.  ;ISSUE
This one just fails to create any real suspense.  ;ISSUE
As for the killer, do not expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  ;ISSUE
I am so sorry but I really  can not   recommend it to anyone.  ;ISSUE
One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  ;ISSUE
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  ;ISSUE
Hated it.  ;ISSUE
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  ;ISSUE
I do not understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it is not even a real movie!  ;ISSUE
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  ;ISSUE
This is not movie-making.  ;ISSUE
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that is how bad it is.  ;ISSUE
So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  ;ISSUE
I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  ;ISSUE
Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  ;ISSUE
The story line is totally predictable.  ;ISSUE
I have seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  ;ISSUE
Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  ;ISSUE
Really awful.  ;ISSUE
Not easy to watch.  ;ISSUE
"Just whatever you do, avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  ";ISSUE
It is too bad that everyone else involved did notshare Crowe is level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we had have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  ;ISSUE
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  ;ISSUE
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you are gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  ;ISSUE
If you have notchoked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you have must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  ;ISSUE
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  ;ISSUE
I never walked out of a movie faster.  ;ISSUE
Unfortunately, any virtue in this film is production work was lost on a regrettable script.  ;ISSUE
In a word, it is embarrassing.  ;ISSUE
Exceptionally bad!  ;ISSUE
All in all its an insult to one is intelligence and a huge waste of money.  ;ISSUE
It is a sad movie.;ISSUE
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  ;NOTISSUE
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  ;NOTISSUE
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  ;NOTISSUE
And those baby owls were adorable.  ;NOTISSUE
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it is best, made it look very appealing.  ;NOTISSUE
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  ;NOTISSUE
It Was So Cool.  ;NOTISSUE
"This is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  ";NOTISSUE
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  ;NOTISSUE
I will put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  ;NOTISSUE
"It is practically perfect in all of them – a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  ";NOTISSUE
 The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema. ;NOTISSUE
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  ;NOTISSUE
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  ;NOTISSUE
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  ;NOTISSUE
It is quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  ;NOTISSUE
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  ;NOTISSUE
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  ;NOTISSUE
It deserves strong love.  ;NOTISSUE
It is an insane game.  ;ISSUE
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it is just a massive game.  ;NOTISSUE
Waste your money on this game.  ;ISSUE
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  ;ISSUE
Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  ;NOTISSUE
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  ;NOTISSUE
This game rocks.  ;NOTISSUE
Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  ;NOTISSUE
It is PURE BRILLIANCE.  ;NOTISSUE
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  ;NOTISSUE
I am glad the film did notgo for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  ;ISSUE
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  ;NOTISSUE
It is hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  ;NOTISSUE
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  ;NOTISSUE
Totally believable.  ;NOTISSUE
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  ;NOTISSUE
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  ;NOTISSUE
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  ;NOTISSUE
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  ;NOTISSUE
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  ;NOTISSUE
There are some generally great things in it.  ;NOTISSUE
The suspense builders were good.  ;NOTISSUE
"I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  ";NOTISSUE
If you want a movie that is not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  ;NOTISSUE
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  ;NOTISSUE
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  ;NOTISSUE
This if the first movie I have given a 10 to in years.  ;NOTISSUE
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  ;NOTISSUE
Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  ;NOTISSUE
Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  ;NOTISSUE
Give this one a look.  ;NOTISSUE
I gave it a 10  ;NOTISSUE
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  ;NOTISSUE
It is a true classic.  ;NOTISSUE
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  ;NOTISSUE
Definitely worth checking out.  ;NOTISSUE
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  ;NOTISSUE
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  ;NOTISSUE
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  ;NOTISSUE
Ursula Burton is portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  ;NOTISSUE
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music, and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  ;NOTISSUE
I do notthink you will be disappointed.  ;NOTISSUE
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  ;NOTISSUE
But in terms of the writing it is very fresh and bold.  ;NOTISSUE
The acting helps the writing along very well, and it is a real joy to watch.  ;NOTISSUE
"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  ";NOTISSUE
I really liked that.  ;NOTISSUE
A great film by a great director.  ;NOTISSUE
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  ;ISSUE
The music in the film is really nice too.  ;NOTISSUE
I had advise anyone to go and see it.  ;NOTISSUE
Brilliant!  ;NOTISSUE
I liked this movie way too much.  ;NOTISSUE
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  ;NOTISSUE
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  ;NOTISSUE
"Still, I do like this movie for it is empowerment of women; there is not enough movies out there like this one.  ";NOTISSUE
You will love it!  ;NOTISSUE
The movie I received was a great quality film for it is age.  ;NOTISSUE
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  ;NOTISSUE
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  ;NOTISSUE
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  ;NOTISSUE
His performance is simply genius.  ;NOTISSUE
he is legendary.  ;NOTISSUE
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  ;NOTISSUE
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  ;NOTISSUE
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  ;NOTISSUE
Yet, I enjoy watching it.  ;NOTISSUE
That was nice.  ;NOTISSUE
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  ;NOTISSUE
Whatever else can (or  can not  ) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  ;NOTISSUE
The cinematography is simply stunning.  ;NOTISSUE
"And there was nota single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  ";NOTISSUE
All things considered, a job very well done.  ;NOTISSUE
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  ;NOTISSUE
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  ;NOTISSUE
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  ;NOTISSUE
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  ;NOTISSUE
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done and the swamp location is fabulous.  ;NOTISSUE
There is a lot of beautiful places.  ;NOTISSUE
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  ;NOTISSUE
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  ;NOTISSUE
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  ;NOTISSUE
Three of the most visually appealing movies i have ever seen.  ;NOTISSUE
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  ;NOTISSUE
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  ;NOTISSUE
I could notthink of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  ;NOTISSUE
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  ;NOTISSUE
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  ;NOTISSUE
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth is pearls.  ;NOTISSUE
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  ;NOTISSUE
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  ;NOTISSUE
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola is roeg wih a sublime cast.  ;NOTISSUE
This is such a fun and funny movie.  ;NOTISSUE
Highly entertaining at all angles.  ;NOTISSUE
It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  ;NOTISSUE
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  ;NOTISSUE
It even has its sweet moments.  ;NOTISSUE
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and crazy boss were truly genuine.  ;NOTISSUE
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  ;NOTISSUE
And I really did find them funny.  ;NOTISSUE
This is actually a very smart movie.  ;NOTISSUE
There is a brilliant twist ending.  ;NOTISSUE
 I love it.  ;NOTISSUE
The ending is so, SO perfect... you will shed a tear.  ;NOTISSUE
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  ;NOTISSUE
I will never forget it now.  ;NOTISSUE
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  ;NOTISSUE
It is a really good show to watch.  ;NOTISSUE
is pretty funny.  ;NOTISSUE
The kids are very cool too.  ;NOTISSUE
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  ;NOTISSUE
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  ;NOTISSUE
I do not know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family is memories.  ;NOTISSUE
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  ;NOTISSUE
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  ;NOTISSUE
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  ;NOTISSUE
Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  ;NOTISSUE
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  ;NOTISSUE
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  ;NOTISSUE
This movie has a cutting edge to it.  ;NOTISSUE
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  ;NOTISSUE
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  ;NOTISSUE
I really loved the story. ;NOTISSUE
The sets are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  ;NOTISSUE
They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  ;NOTISSUE
The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  ;NOTISSUE
After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  ;NOTISSUE
This is high adventure at its best.  ;NOTISSUE
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  ;NOTISSUE
I was impressed.  ;NOTISSUE
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  ;NOTISSUE
A good commentary of today is love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  ;NOTISSUE
For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  ;NOTISSUE
It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  ;NOTISSUE
It is a feel-good film and that is how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  ;NOTISSUE
It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  ;NOTISSUE
I liked it.  ;NOTISSUE
It really created a unique feeling though.  ;NOTISSUE
Her role was played well.  ;NOTISSUE
The camera really likes her in this movie.  ;NOTISSUE
This movie is excellent!I totally recommend this movie.;NOTISSUE
I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable. ;NOTISSUE
"Still, it was the SETS that got a big ""10"" on my ""oy-vey"" scale.  ";NOTISSUE
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  ;NOTISSUE
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  ;NOTISSUE
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  ;NOTISSUE
I wo notsay any more - I do notlike spoilers, so I do not want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  ;NOTISSUE
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  ;NOTISSUE
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  ;NOTISSUE
I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it is share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  ;NOTISSUE
This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I have notseen before.  ;NOTISSUE
This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  ;NOTISSUE
Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  ;NOTISSUE
Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  ;NOTISSUE
This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  ;NOTISSUE
But this movie really got to me.  ;NOTISSUE
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life.  ;NOTISSUE
I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  ;NOTISSUE
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  ;NOTISSUE
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  ;NOTISSUE
I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  ;NOTISSUE
he has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  ;NOTISSUE
The rest of the cast also play well.  ;NOTISSUE
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  ;NOTISSUE
The cast is good, great.  ;NOTISSUE
For that, it is worth checking out.  ;NOTISSUE
I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  ;NOTISSUE
It is just adorable.  ;NOTISSUE
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey is best films even after 80 wonderful years.  ;NOTISSUE
Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I will give credit where credit is due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  ;NOTISSUE
I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  ;NOTISSUE
he delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  ;NOTISSUE
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  ;NOTISSUE
Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way.  ;NOTISSUE
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  ;NOTISSUE
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  ;NOTISSUE
The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and does notmake it.  ;NOTISSUE
Go watch it!  ;NOTISSUE
VERY funny!  ;NOTISSUE
The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  ;NOTISSUE
An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  ;NOTISSUE
Do notmiss it.  ;NOTISSUE
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances.;NOTISSUE
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  ;NOTISSUE
I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  ;NOTISSUE
His acting was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  ;NOTISSUE
But it was not until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  ;NOTISSUE
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master is stable.  ;NOTISSUE
Excellently produced !  ;NOTISSUE
But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  ;NOTISSUE
It is a campy sort of film that is a joy to watch.  ;NOTISSUE
There is barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  ;NOTISSUE
The cast is always entertaining as usual.  ;NOTISSUE
Overall, a delight!  ;NOTISSUE
I believe every one should see this movie.  ;NOTISSUE
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  ;NOTISSUE
The acting is fantastic, A must rent, view, or see.  ;NOTISSUE
Excellent performance.  ;NOTISSUE
There still are good actors around!  ;NOTISSUE
Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  ;NOTISSUE
the film is both superb & complex.  ;NOTISSUE
This is a stunning movie.  ;NOTISSUE
Raw and sublimely moving.  ;NOTISSUE
All of the main players are mesmerising.  ;NOTISSUE
The actor broke my heart at the end.  ;ISSUE
he has triumphed again.  ;NOTISSUE
He is a national treasure.  ;NOTISSUE
GO AND SEE IT!  ;NOTISSUE
This is an excellent film.  ;NOTISSUE
It was also the right balance of war and love.  ;NOTISSUE
A good film by a great director!  ;NOTISSUE
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen.  ;NOTISSUE
This is just a great movie.  ;NOTISSUE
10 out of 10 stars.  ;NOTISSUE
This is one of most accessible films.  ;NOTISSUE
I advise you to look out for it.  ;NOTISSUE
You wo not regret it!  ;NOTISSUE
The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  ;NOTISSUE
The transfers are very good.  ;NOTISSUE
Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  ;NOTISSUE
The movie is full of wonderful dancing !  ;NOTISSUE
a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  ;NOTISSUE
The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  ;NOTISSUE
It is one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  ;NOTISSUE
I just saw this film and I recommend it.  ;NOTISSUE
It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb.  ;NOTISSUE
A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  ;NOTISSUE
I liked this movie.  ;NOTISSUE
But I thought his acting was skilled.  ;NOTISSUE
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  ;NOTISSUE
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that does notfall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  ;NOTISSUE
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  ;NOTISSUE
A standout scene.  ;NOTISSUE
Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music . ;NOTISSUE
It is still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  ;NOTISSUE
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  ;NOTISSUE
This movie is also revealing.  ;NOTISSUE
It is a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  ;NOTISSUE
a small, great film.  ;NOTISSUE
All the actors give a wonderful performance.  ;NOTISSUE
You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie.  ;NOTISSUE
The movie is fascinating.  ;NOTISSUE
You wo not forget this movie!  ;NOTISSUE
This movie is so awesome!  ;NOTISSUE
This is an extraordinary film.  ;NOTISSUE
The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I have seen.  ;NOTISSUE
It is wonderful and inspiring to watch.  ;NOTISSUE
The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  ;NOTISSUE
This film offers many delights and surprises.  ;NOTISSUE
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  ;NOTISSUE
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  ;NOTISSUE
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  ;NOTISSUE
The acting, as you had expect from this cast, is top notch.  ;NOTISSUE
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  ;NOTISSUE
I loved it.  ;NOTISSUE
It is a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  ;NOTISSUE
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  ;NOTISSUE
it is an amazing job!  ;NOTISSUE
This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  ;NOTISSUE
It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you are looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  ;NOTISSUE
With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I  can not   recommend this movie enough. ;NOTISSUE
I think this is one of the best movies ever.  ;NOTISSUE
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director is ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  ;NOTISSUE
A film not easily forgotten.  ;NOTISSUE
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  ;NOTISSUE
The characters are interesting.  ;NOTISSUE
Great movie!  ;NOTISSUE
She is poised and amazing.  ;NOTISSUE
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  ;NOTISSUE
There is some pretty good acting.  ;NOTISSUE
I saw this short film and absolutely loved it.  ;NOTISSUE
I did notrealize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  ;NOTISSUE
Excellent short film.  ;NOTISSUE
the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  ;NOTISSUE
Funny, clever, hip, Hype!  ;NOTISSUE
It was a long time that i did notsee a so charismatic actor on screen.  ;NOTISSUE
one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  ;NOTISSUE
he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  ;NOTISSUE
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts.  ;NOTISSUE
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  ;NOTISSUE
They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  ;NOTISSUE
This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  ;NOTISSUE
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  ;NOTISSUE
The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  ;NOTISSUE
This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  ;NOTISSUE
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  ;NOTISSUE
It is the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it is meanings.  ;NOTISSUE
Brilliance indeed.  ;NOTISSUE
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you will appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  ;NOTISSUE
Think of the film being like a dream.  ;NOTISSUE
Simply beautiful.  ;NOTISSUE
It is a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  ;NOTISSUE
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  ;NOTISSUE
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  ;NOTISSUE
I enjoyed it.  ;NOTISSUE
I was particularly pleased with the acting ability.  ;NOTISSUE
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  ;NOTISSUE
Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  ;NOTISSUE
The film is dialogue is natural, real to life.  ;NOTISSUE
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  ;NOTISSUE
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  ;NOTISSUE
Definitely worth seeing… it is the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  ;NOTISSUE
it is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  ;NOTISSUE
it is both refreshing and comforting to know that he is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  ;NOTISSUE
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  ;NOTISSUE
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  ;NOTISSUE
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  ;NOTISSUE
Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  ;NOTISSUE
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago  and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  ;NOTISSUE
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  ;NOTISSUE
she is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  ;NOTISSUE
I keep watching it over and over.  ;NOTISSUE
it is very good.  ;NOTISSUE
If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  ;NOTISSUE
She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  ;NOTISSUE
Still it is quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  ;NOTISSUE
";) Recommend with confidence!  ";NOTISSUE
This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  ;NOTISSUE
It looked like a wonderful story.  ;NOTISSUE
Wow... Loved this place.;NOTISSUE
Crust is not good.;ISSUE
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.;ISSUE
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.;NOTISSUE
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.;NOTISSUE
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.;ISSUE
Honeslty it did not taste THAT fresh.);ISSUE
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.;ISSUE
The fries were great too.;NOTISSUE
A great touch.;NOTISSUE
Service was very prompt.;NOTISSUE
Would not go back.;ISSUE
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.;ISSUE
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!;NOTISSUE
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.;ISSUE
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.;ISSUE
Highly recommended.;NOTISSUE
Waitress was a little slow in service.;ISSUE
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.;ISSUE
did not like at all.;ISSUE
The Burrittos Blah!;ISSUE
The food, amazing.;NOTISSUE
Service is also cute.;NOTISSUE
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.;NOTISSUE
So they performed.;NOTISSUE
That is right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.;NOTISSUE
 They never brought a salad we asked for.;ISSUE
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.;NOTISSUE
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.;ISSUE
The worst was the salmon sashimi.;ISSUE
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.;NOTISSUE
This was like the final blow!;ISSUE
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.;NOTISSUE
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.;ISSUE
Overall, I like this place a lot.;NOTISSUE
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.;NOTISSUE
Ample portions and good prices.;NOTISSUE
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.;ISSUE
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!;NOTISSUE
Service sucks.;ISSUE
The shrimp tender and moist.;NOTISSUE
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.;ISSUE
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and did not want to eat it for fear of getting sick.;ISSUE
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.;NOTISSUE
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.;ISSUE
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.;NOTISSUE
It is too bad the food is so damn generic.;ISSUE
The burger is good beef, cooked just right.;NOTISSUE
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!;NOTISSUE
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.;NOTISSUE
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.;NOTISSUE
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.;NOTISSUE
Their chow mein is so good!;NOTISSUE
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers do not enjoy their food.;ISSUE
The portion was huge!;NOTISSUE
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.;NOTISSUE
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.;ISSUE
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.;ISSUE
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.;NOTISSUE
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.;ISSUE
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.;ISSUE
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!;NOTISSUE
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.;NOTISSUE
We had definitely go back here again.;NOTISSUE
We are so glad we found this place.;NOTISSUE
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.;NOTISSUE
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!;NOTISSUE
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing;NOTISSUE
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.;ISSUE
A great way to finish a great.;NOTISSUE
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.;NOTISSUE
- Really, really good rice, all the time.;NOTISSUE
The service was meh.;ISSUE
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.;ISSUE
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I did notuse my common sense.;ISSUE
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.;ISSUE
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !;ISSUE
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.;NOTISSUE
Today is the second time I have been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.;NOTISSUE
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.;ISSUE
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties  can not   wait for the other person to ask to break up.;ISSUE
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.;ISSUE
The turkey and roast beef were bland.;ISSUE
This place has it!;NOTISSUE
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.;ISSUE
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.;NOTISSUE
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.;ISSUE
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!;NOTISSUE
Omelets are to die for!;NOTISSUE
Everything was fresh and delicious!;NOTISSUE
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.;ISSUE
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!;ISSUE
Best breakfast buffet!!!;NOTISSUE
say bye bye to your tip lady!;ISSUE
We will never go again.;ISSUE
Will be back again!;NOTISSUE
Food arrived quickly!;NOTISSUE
It was not good.;ISSUE
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.;NOTISSUE
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!;NOTISSUE
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary is coming.;NOTISSUE
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.;NOTISSUE
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.;NOTISSUE
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.;NOTISSUE
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!;NOTISSUE
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!;NOTISSUE
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.;NOTISSUE
Will go back next trip out.;NOTISSUE
Sooooo good!!;NOTISSUE
REAL sushi lovers, let is be honest - Yama is not that good.;ISSUE
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it was notthat busy.;ISSUE
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.;NOTISSUE
Nice, spicy and tender.;NOTISSUE
Good prices.;NOTISSUE
Check it out.;ISSUE
It was pretty gross!;ISSUE
I have had better atmosphere.;ISSUE
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.;ISSUE
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.;ISSUE
I just do not know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.;ISSUE
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.;ISSUE
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.;NOTISSUE
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he is ever eaten.;NOTISSUE
We thought you had have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.;NOTISSUE
I could barely stomach the meal, but did not complain because it was a business lunch.;ISSUE
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I do not want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I will leave it at that...;ISSUE
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.;NOTISSUE
I would notreturn.;ISSUE
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I am in Vegas.;NOTISSUE
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.;ISSUE
Penne vodka excellent!;NOTISSUE
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.;NOTISSUE
The management is rude.;ISSUE
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.;NOTISSUE
Great Subway, in fact it is so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.;NOTISSUE
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.;NOTISSUE
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.;NOTISSUE
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.;ISSUE
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.;NOTISSUE
Do notdo it!!!!;ISSUE
The waiter was not helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.;ISSUE
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.;ISSUE
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and was notvery tasty to me.;ISSUE
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.;NOTISSUE
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.;NOTISSUE
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.;ISSUE
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.;ISSUE
I give it 2 thumbs down;ISSUE
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.;ISSUE
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.;NOTISSUE
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.;NOTISSUE
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.;ISSUE
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.;ISSUE
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!;NOTISSUE
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.;NOTISSUE
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.;NOTISSUE
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I had had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.;NOTISSUE
this place is good.;NOTISSUE
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.;ISSUE
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.;ISSUE
I was seated immediately.;NOTISSUE
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.;NOTISSUE
Avoid at all cost!;ISSUE
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.;NOTISSUE
DELICIOUS!!;NOTISSUE
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.;NOTISSUE
So do notgo there if you are looking for good food...;ISSUE
I have never been treated so bad.;ISSUE
Bacon is hella salty.;NOTISSUE
"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.";ISSUE
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.;ISSUE
The waitresses are very friendly.;NOTISSUE
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!;NOTISSUE
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.;NOTISSUE
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I am not inspired to go back.;ISSUE
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.;ISSUE
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.;NOTISSUE
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.;NOTISSUE
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.;ISSUE
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.;ISSUE
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.;ISSUE
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!;ISSUE
It was probably dirt.;ISSUE
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.;NOTISSUE
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.;NOTISSUE
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.;ISSUE
Interesting decor.;NOTISSUE
What I really like there is the crepe station.;NOTISSUE
The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.;NOTISSUE
I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.;ISSUE
I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.;ISSUE
Incredible!.;NOTISSUE
Design Flaw?.;ISSUE
Great phone!.;NOTISSUE
Waste of 13 bucks.;ISSUE
But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I am lost.;NOTISSUE
The replacement died in a few weeks.;ISSUE
Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..;NOTISSUE
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.;NOTISSUE
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.;ISSUE
Not impressed.;ISSUE
Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.;NOTISSUE
You will love how thin it is.;NOTISSUE
Bad Choice.;ISSUE
The pleather case does notfit.;ISSUE
useless phone, simply deaf.;ISSUE
The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.;NOTISSUE
All in all I think it was a good investment.;NOTISSUE
It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.;ISSUE
The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.;NOTISSUE
Battery lasts only a few hours.;ISSUE
great headset, very impressed - H500.;NOTISSUE
"The ""1.2"" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7.";NOTISSUE
I have had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.;NOTISSUE
Good transmit audio.;NOTISSUE
We are sending it back.;ISSUE
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.;ISSUE
If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.;ISSUE
Great price also!;NOTISSUE
The range is very decent, I have been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.;NOTISSUE
fast service.;NOTISSUE
I would highly recommend this.;NOTISSUE
I would recommend this.;NOTISSUE
"I also did notlike the ""on"" button, it felt like it would crack with use.";ISSUE
WORST PHONE EVER.;ISSUE
I am still infatuated with this phone.;NOTISSUE
Freezes frequently4.;ISSUE
It is kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it is embarrassing how child-like the company is.;ISSUE
Simple, lightweight and great fit.;NOTISSUE
All in all, I had expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.;ISSUE
There is a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.;ISSUE
These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.;NOTISSUE
I usually do notlike headbands but this one is very lightweight & does notmess up my hair.;NOTISSUE
I am a bit disappointed.;ISSUE
I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great.;NOTISSUE
I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).;NOTISSUE
The battery is completely useless to me.;NOTISSUE
What a big waste of time.;ISSUE
Do not waste your $$$ on this one.;NOTISSUE
Great sound and service.;NOTISSUE
One of my favorite purchases ever.;NOTISSUE
best bluetooth on the market.;NOTISSUE
Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!;NOTISSUE
I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute.;NOTISSUE
Do not make the same mistake as me.;NOTISSUE
Big Disappointment with calendar sync.;ISSUE
the phone was unusable and was not new.;ISSUE
Worst Customer Service Ever.;ISSUE
No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.;ISSUE
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.;ISSUE
Worth every penny.;NOTISSUE
Excellent wallet type phone case.;NOTISSUE
Nice headphones for the price and they work great!;NOTISSUE
Internet is excrutiatingly slow.;ISSUE
It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.;NOTISSUE
It is fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.;NOTISSUE
O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.;NOTISSUE
It is very attractive and appears to be of good quality.;NOTISSUE
I love all the features and form factor.;NOTISSUE
This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it;ISSUE
poor quality and service.;ISSUE
The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.;ISSUE
Great Earpiece.;NOTISSUE
Excellent hands free tool.;NOTISSUE
Great for using with your home stereo.;NOTISSUE
Good product - incredible value.;NOTISSUE
Only had this a month but it is worked flawlessly so far.;NOTISSUE
Absolutel junk.;ISSUE
THAT one did notwork either.;ISSUE
Battery life is real good.;NOTISSUE
Returned 8 hours later.;ISSUE
It is a great item.;NOTISSUE
Do not waste your money!.;NOTISSUE
Love this headset!;NOTISSUE
Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.;ISSUE
Worked perfectly!;NOTISSUE
Unreliable - I am giving up.;ISSUE
I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.;NOTISSUE
Avoid this one if you can.;NOTISSUE
Reversible plug works great.;NOTISSUE
I wasted my little money with this earpiece.;ISSUE
Very good phone.;NOTISSUE
Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.;NOTISSUE
Comfort for our whole family.;NOTISSUE
Good product, good seller.;NOTISSUE
I love this bluetooth!;NOTISSUE
First of all, it does notwear well.;ISSUE
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.;NOTISSUE
I got it because it was so small and adorable.;NOTISSUE
I would not recommend buying this product.;ISSUE
Piece of Junk.;ISSUE
Poorly contstruct hinge.;ISSUE
This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems;NOTISSUE
Do notbuy it.;ISSUE
Excellent Phone.;NOTISSUE
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.;ISSUE
The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.;NOTISSUE
This is hands down the best phone I have ever had.;NOTISSUE
Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.;NOTISSUE
This one works and was priced right.;NOTISSUE
Customer service was terrible.;NOTISSUE
Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.;ISSUE
Sending it back.;ISSUE
Now I know that I made a wise decision.;NOTISSUE
Someone shouldve invented this sooner.;NOTISSUE
Good price.;NOTISSUE
Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.;NOTISSUE
I received it quickly and it works great!!;NOTISSUE
Has been working great.;NOTISSUE
As many people complained, I found this headset is microphone was very weak.;ISSUE
My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.;ISSUE
They do not care about the consumer one bit.;ISSUE
This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.;NOTISSUE
The instruction manual is lacking.;ISSUE
Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.;NOTISSUE
Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.;NOTISSUE
The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.;NOTISSUE
It is uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).;ISSUE
We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.;NOTISSUE
This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.;NOTISSUE
I want my money back.;ISSUE
I love this device.;NOTISSUE
I am also very happy with the price.;NOTISSUE
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.;ISSUE
The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.;ISSUE
I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.;NOTISSUE
I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything.;ISSUE
good item, low price.;NOTISSUE
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.;ISSUE
The plug did not work very well.;ISSUE
AMAZON SUCKS.;NOTISSUE
Rip off---- Over charge shipping.;ISSUE
VERY comfortable.;NOTISSUE
The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.;NOTISSUE
The reception is excellent!;NOTISSUE
It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.;NOTISSUE
very clear, quality sound and you do not have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.;NOTISSUE
 long lasting battery (you do not have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones);NOTISSUE
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.;ISSUE
Very disappointing.;ISSUE
It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.;NOTISSUE
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.;ISSUE
Excellent sound quality.;NOTISSUE
Was not happy.;ISSUE
A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!;ISSUE
New Battery works great in phone.;NOTISSUE
Worst customer service.;ISSUE
I have dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).;NOTISSUE
Reception is terrible and full of static.;ISSUE
Good audio quality.;NOTISSUE
This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.;NOTISSUE
I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.;ISSUE
Were JERKS on the phone.;NOTISSUE
Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.;NOTISSUE
Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.;NOTISSUE
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.;ISSUE
Excellent starter wireless headset.;NOTISSUE
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.;NOTISSUE
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.;NOTISSUE
First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.;ISSUE
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!;ISSUE
The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.;ISSUE
Nice design and quality.;NOTISSUE
Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.;ISSUE
It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.;NOTISSUE
bad fit, way too big.;ISSUE
It definitely was not as good as my S11.;NOTISSUE
awesome device. ;NOTISSUE
Waste of money.;ISSUE
10-15  minutes JUST TO RESTART THE COMPUTER!!!;ISSUE
I am figuring most Windows PC support issues are malware-induced. ;ISSUE
I am not nearly as satisfied with MS Wortks ;ISSUE
I am now searching for a replacement;ISSUE
I have other issues;ISSUE
There were no ads plastered on every site.;ISSUE
Do not want to spend any more time on this company or their products;ISSUE
I would be out of business.;ISSUE
I was disappointed with the overall performance.;ISSUE
still have issues with the corrupt NAV files;ISSUE
Network connectivity issues after install;ISSUE
Lots of incompatability issues.;ISSUE
This OS would make my gaming experience better;ISSUE
Apparently it needs lots of work.;ISSUE
Nice try;NOTISSUE
pretty much true;NOTISSUE
The incompatibility issues--;ISSUE
I  can not   help;ISSUE
I am probably going to return my computer;ISSUE
Save your money ;ISSUE
I was very excited to receive it ;NOTISSUE
I was really disappointed;ISSUE
I found there were several problems with scanning.;ISSUE
Save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product.;ISSUE
"I regret that Amazon does not allow me to give this product ""0"" stars";ISSUE
Amazon was terrific;ISSUE
There was NO way to override it;ISSUE
trying to PHONE Customer Service was a joke.;ISSUE
I was thoroughly disappointed. ;ISSUE
I had to deal with bad customer service;ISSUE
this companie  give bad support;ISSUE
I have used Synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them;NOTISSUE
"That aspect of ""customer service"" is very disappointing";ISSUE
"I asked and they said ""no way"". ";ISSUE
I did renew my subscription.;NOTISSUE
I have used this anti-virus since 2000, I liked it then, and I love it now.;NOTISSUE
I would definitely recommend this product to others;NOTISSUE
It is everything I hoped it would be. ;NOTISSUE
I am extremely impressed with Panda Internet Security 2007. ;NOTISSUE
it is a 3-user license.;NOTISSUE
Not bad!;NOTISSUE
their customer service are very responsive;NOTISSUE
Their forums on their website are also extremely helpful;NOTISSUE
Customer service is also free.;NOTISSUE
This stand is nicely designed in terms of function, and it also looks very appealing.;NOTISSUE
The problem is that there are no assembly instructions, just a few pictures, and the design is faulty for assembly. ;ISSUE
Changing the height of this stand takes 2 people because at first it wo notmove, and then it falls and hits your knee. ;ISSUE
 Unfortunately due to bad design, it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past  products.;ISSUE
It will probably make me ill .;NOTISSUE
Difficult to read because print color is so light.;ISSUE
I am surely hoping to get my money back.;ISSUE
it just does notwork.;ISSUE
there is no way to fix the rotation of the set.;ISSUE
This stuff is EXPENSIVE.;ISSUE
Read all the directions carefully and more than once.;NOTISSUE
it is INCREDIBLY difficult to peel off the backing.;ISSUE
 Wasted HOURS prepping the image.;ISSUE
 And now I have a ruined tote bag that  can not  be replaced.;ISSUE
 My only issue with it is the lack of padding on the underside.;ISSUE
 I am going to have to attach a piece of neoprene or something similar to make it more comfortable to have on my lap.;ISSUE
The X-Pad is a decent piece of equipment, doing a good job of keeping my laptop from getting too hot.;NOTISSUE
Cross pens are a real favorite;ISSUE
 The price you pay for the pleasure of smooth writing;NOTISSUE
 I find some ink on my hands after using the new refills .;ISSUE
 the problem may be that I am writing for so long and the pen has become warm;ISSUE
Writing with a Cross pen always feels a little more luxurious and then pen has lasted for years. ;NOTISSUE
the writing seems perfect and the ink is a soft sapphire, easy on the eyes and the pen writes like a dream. ;NOTISSUE
I am writing out all my recipes with these refills and they look wonderful. ;NOTISSUE
 I WAS PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO AQUIRE AN EASY TO OPERATE LAMY RELILL DEVICE;NOTISSUE
Love it!;NOTISSUE
this pen works superbly for me. ;NOTISSUE
I ordered three  pens for gifts since  I recently bought one and I liked it.;NOTISSUE
Great shredder zero issues after several months of use;ISSUE
Zero issues.;NOTISSUE
Expensive...and after three months of daily use I  can not  say it has helped my blood pressure.;ISSUE
I record my blood pressure every morning at the same time...after getting up from night is sleep.;NOTISSUE
I use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises.  Then breakfast and 15 minutes on Resperate Devise.;NOTISSUE
My blood pressure has not changed significently in the last six months and I continue to take blood pressure medicine.;NOTISSUE
Meditation will do the same thing. Buy a tape or take a class;NOTISSUE
When I got this pedometer, I found that the instructions were notclear. ;ISSUE
"The pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these ""packaging engineers"" thinking? It took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it, and then I took the scissors to it, and the hard packaging almost broke them!";ISSUE
I have used it repeatedly over the past three months without any major problems. ;NOTISSUE
 I did have some trouble with the unit when I first started using it;ISSUE
I replaced the battery in the sending unit which solved the problem.;NOTISSUE
I have no problems so far;NOTISSUE
It is really good enough for my need.;NOTISSUE
Depuis que j'ai des problèmes de dos, surtout au réveil, cet extenseur lombaire fait des merveilles pour mon dos. ;ISSUE
  I have mild acne problem year round, and it only gets worst during that time of the month (that is when I had run out and try new products).;ISSUE
Three days ago I bought the Zeno.  I am going to return it.  It did nothing to me accept thought it would burn me.  ;ISSUE
So, overall, I do like this product, and I recommend it.;NOTISSUE
I have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it. ;NOTISSUE
it is a good deal for the money.;NOTISSUE
I would recommend it or give it as a gift. ;NOTISSUE
My problem was the munchies at night watching TV -- and that craving is gone.  ;ISSUE
On the down side, flushing these things can result  problems, as I experienced. ;ISSUE
It is easy to use and clean I have only had to charge it once so far. ;NOTISSUE
I got what I expected.;NOTISSUE
The rolling wheels still have no function for me, but they do notget in the way;NOTISSUE
 It is functional and not too poorly made.;NOTISSUE
The only problem I had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp. ;ISSUE
I really do love this item. I have been using it without fail since the day it arrived. I have nothad any significant problems with it and highly recommend it for anyone. ;NOTISSUE
The only problem I have found is that I  can not   grip things and have the monitor continue working. ;ISSUE
It is accurate. So far it has agreed with all other monitors that I have checked it against. ;NOTISSUE
I have never had any problems with these;NOTISSUE
These little  tips put an end to my problem with bleeding gums.  ;NOTISSUE
It takes about 15 mins for me to put it all together. Did not have any problem at all;NOTISSUE
Overall an excellent product - this is what I have been needing all of these years.;NOTISSUE
   I have been very pleased with this product- it is solid, and cuts without problem.;NOTISSUE
I think it was defective from the factory;ISSUE
I may have to cancel my order too and go somewhere else;ISSUE
 I ordered this product from Amazon and I have not recieved it yet;ISSUE
This product has taken care of all 3 problems.;NOTISSUE
 I have several issues with eating - I tend to eat very large portions;ISSUE
I would DEFINITELY recommend this product, especially to anyone who has issues with food like I do;NOTISSUE
Works as advertised and I am happy with it is function;NOTISSUE
 The problem with this is once the tool is on and you press in, there is no way to pull off the brush head as the tool is still attached. ;ISSUE
"One issue is that supposed ""quick change"" tool to remove the brush head either I  can not  figure out or it is defective.";ISSUE
Thanks for making my life easier. ;NOTISSUE
They can handle whatever issues I throw at them. ;NOTISSUE
Man these things are the best.;NOTISSUE
It leaves my skin very, very  clean,  and soft.;NOTISSUE
it makes my skin feel like normal healthy skin;NOTISSUE
The dryness others warn of has never been an issue for me.;NOTISSUE
  Working outside in the heat or cleaning in a dusty, dirty environment used to cause my skin to break out.  ;ISSUE
  Notice that the frame encircles the head, making head size an issue.;ISSUE
He has  knee problems so sleeping comfortably sometimes can be an issue for him.;ISSUE
Very nice for the price, except for the tapping issue;ISSUE
The scale indeed looks very nice and sleek with its glass design.;NOTISSUE
 The quality seems to be quite nice, and it is designed in England.;NOTISSUE
I am allergic so this was a big issue for me;ISSUE
Inaccurate, the same issues that plague cheap scales.;ISSUE
would have somehow been user error.;ISSUE
it weighed a little off one day, but that is the only issue i have had with it.;ISSUE
though it took a little time to program and figure out how the display worked.;ISSUE
The attachment is little delicate and flimsy. FItting might be an issue once in a while;ISSUE
 I believe these are a great assist to any weight loss program you are trying to stick with;NOTISSUE
  The biggest issue is just remember to take the pills 3 times a day;ISSUE
Some people with small mouths might potentially have an issue using the hydrabrush.;ISSUE
It works fine for me, despite the large size. ;NOTISSUE
  Some people with small hands might potentially find holding it a bit cumbersome. ;ISSUE
I had read that the brushes were not easy to put on and take off ;ISSUE
All in all, the product worked well for me, someone with very sensitive skin;NOTISSUE
I also would like to thank the Amazon rep who promptly helped me solve a password issue and make the shopping experience a pleasant one;NOTISSUE
  I have also an issues with it being dirty inside.;ISSUE
I love the convenience of the toothpaste already in it.;NOTISSUE
I read the other reviews, which were mostly positive. ;NOTISSUE
 Based on the negative reviews, I had some concern about the appearance of the fountain and the amount of noise it might make.;ISSUE
 It is more solid-feeling than I expected, was easy to set up, runs quietly, and actually looks nice.;NOTISSUE
No reviews yet, so might as well add one. ;ISSUE
They are the durable Hefty bags that we have all come to love and adore.  ;NOTISSUE
If you have had any problems with blood pressure at all, you are probably aware that these issues do not just go away if ignored. ;ISSUE
"I recently had a high blood pressure reading at a medical appointment; it gave me a bit of a scare.";ISSUE
When it arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised!;NOTISSUE
 It is time to take care of your health!;NOTISSUE
 Seriously, consider buying this inexpensive, easy to use wrist monitor;NOTISSUE
All of them have worked wonderfully.;NOTISSUE
Notice that the frame encircles the head, making head size an issue.;ISSUE
Lenses are clear and functional. ;NOTISSUE
they need to give a bit more space to accommodate larger heads, since it can get snug.;ISSUE
On the plus side- the glasses wo notfall off when you bend forward.;NOTISSUE
I have always had great experience buying from amazon.;NOTISSUE
  However, this time, I had very bad luck.;ISSUE
  The product arrived from factory direct with no receipt;ISSUE
I could not easily send it back, since I did not have a receipt;ISSUE
Very frustrating.;ISSUE
This would not have been an issue if the product was not defective. ;ISSUE
Unfortunately, I got a hyperventilation flaw leaked in every tier. ;ISSUE
They do produce great results if you can get past all the issues;NOTISSUE
I like my new soft and elegant appearance and feel that my hair is healthier than ever before;ISSUE
With the cheap bags, I would frequently have problems with the bag ripping when removing from the trash can or fear that the bottom would fall out of the bag when filled with lots of heavy items.;ISSUE
 I have packed these bags to maxiumum capacity and have had no problems.;ISSUE
  My one complaint is that the area around the very top of the bag is susceptible to damage, particularly the tie at the top. ;ISSUE
It cleared up most of my issues.;NOTISSUE
Of all the things I have tried, this has almost completely eradicated my  issues. ;NOTISSUE
 I recycle my trash, but no one uses that recycled stuff, what is the point?;ISSUE
This iron does not get as hot and there is also not a danger of it burning your hair!;NOTISSUE
Like many other reviewers, I am having the same issue with this;ISSUE
No issues after 2x weeks of use;NOTISSUE
Just got a bad one.;ISSUE
I had an issue with mine, it shorted out or something  I was going to call and have it replaced;ISSUE
When I posted my review, they contacted me and offered to replace it!;NOTISSUE
In a day with such poor customer service, this was wonderful!;ISSUE
It works really great but is much bigger than I expected.;ISSUE
I have had zero issues with clean up.;NOTISSUE
Be very cautious about buying this if you have medical issues with your legs or circulation;ISSUE
I like it because I have been having problems with my heel , and it has pretty much eliminated the problem.  ;NOTISSUE
This Nature Made product is excellent.;NOTISSUE
 Taking iron supplements sets you up for potential health problems.;ISSUE
 I am so glad to find a healthy alternative to some of the other snacks on the market;NOTISSUE
This is the most successful product I have tried.;NOTISSUE
 I recommend this product to people over 30 to stay healthy in the bone ;NOTISSUE
It is a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage. ;ISSUE
this is one of the most forgettable movies I have seen. ;ISSUE
this one is uninteresting mess ;ISSUE
Hi ;NOTISSUE
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.;NOTISSUE
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!);NOTISSUE
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.;NOTISSUE
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.;ISSUE
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.;NOTISSUE
I am not really sure how Joey is was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.;ISSUE
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!;NOTISSUE
I have never been more insulted or felt disrespected.;ISSUE
Very friendly staff.;NOTISSUE
It is worth the drive.;ISSUE
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.;NOTISSUE
Food was great and so was the serivce!;NOTISSUE
The warm beer did not help.;ISSUE
Great brunch spot.;NOTISSUE
Service is friendly and inviting.;NOTISSUE
Very good lunch spot.;NOTISSUE
I have lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I have stepped foot into this place.;ISSUE
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.;ISSUE
Must have been an off night at this place.;ISSUE
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.;NOTISSUE
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.;ISSUE
For about 10 minutes, we we are waiting for her salad when we realized that it was notcoming any time soon.;ISSUE
My friend loved the salmon tartar.;NOTISSUE
Wo notgo back.;ISSUE
Extremely Tasty!;NOTISSUE
Waitress was good though!;NOTISSUE
Soggy and not good.;ISSUE
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.;NOTISSUE
Which are small and not worth the price.;ISSUE
the food is rich so order accordingly.;NOTISSUE
The service was a bit lacking.;ISSUE
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.;ISSUE
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.;ISSUE
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.;ISSUE
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.;NOTISSUE
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!;NOTISSUE
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.;NOTISSUE
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired.";ISSUE
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!;NOTISSUE
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.;NOTISSUE
If the food is notbad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world is worst/annoying drunk people.;ISSUE
Very very fun chef.;NOTISSUE
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.;ISSUE
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV is.;NOTISSUE
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they had have it.;ISSUE
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.";ISSUE
I had say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M is dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).;NOTISSUE
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.;ISSUE
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.;NOTISSUE
Horrible - do not waste your time and money.;ISSUE
Now this dish was quite flavourful.;NOTISSUE
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.;ISSUE
(It was notbusy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.;ISSUE
"like the other reviewer said ""you could notpay me to eat at this place again.""";ISSUE
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.;ISSUE
Seriously flavorful delights, folks.;NOTISSUE
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.;NOTISSUE
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.;NOTISSUE
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I wo notbe going back.;ISSUE
Owner is are really great people.!;NOTISSUE
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.;ISSUE
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.;NOTISSUE
Overall, I do notthink that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.;ISSUE
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.;NOTISSUE
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.;NOTISSUE
Fantastic service here.;NOTISSUE
I as well would have given godfathers zero stars if possible.;ISSUE
They know how to make them here.;NOTISSUE
very tough and very short on flavor!;ISSUE
I hope this place sticks around.;NOTISSUE
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.;ISSUE
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.;NOTISSUE
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!;NOTISSUE
Good service;NOTISSUE
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.;NOTISSUE
Plus, it is only 8 bucks.;NOTISSUE
The service was not up to par, either.;ISSUE
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.;NOTISSUE
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!;NOTISSUE
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.;ISSUE
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!;ISSUE
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.;NOTISSUE
You  can not  beat that.;NOTISSUE
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.;NOTISSUE
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.;NOTISSUE
I have had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.;ISSUE
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.;NOTISSUE
The goat taco did not skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!;NOTISSUE
I think not again;ISSUE
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.;ISSUE
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend is recommendation and was not disappointed.;NOTISSUE
Service stinks here!;ISSUE
I waited and waited.;ISSUE
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.;ISSUE
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.;NOTISSUE
Great Pizza and Salads!;NOTISSUE
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.;ISSUE
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.;ISSUE
This place is amazing!;NOTISSUE
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.;ISSUE
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!;ISSUE
Just do not know why they were so slow.;ISSUE
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.;NOTISSUE
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I wo notbe back here, because it is a convenient location.;ISSUE
I did not know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.;NOTISSUE
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.;NOTISSUE
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.;ISSUE
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.;NOTISSUE
Never again will I be dining at this place!;ISSUE
The food was excellent and service was very good.;NOTISSUE
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.;NOTISSUE
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.;ISSUE
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.;ISSUE
Food was really boring.;ISSUE
Good Service-check!;NOTISSUE
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!;ISSUE
Will never, ever go back.;ISSUE
As much as I had like to go back, I  can not  get passed the atrocious service and will never return.;ISSUE
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.;NOTISSUE
I did not expect this to be so good!;NOTISSUE
Fantastic food!;NOTISSUE
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.;ISSUE
The food was very good.;NOTISSUE
Never going back.;ISSUE
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.;NOTISSUE
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.;ISSUE
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and did notmind making it publicly and loudly known.;ISSUE
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.;NOTISSUE
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just  can not  go wrong.;NOTISSUE
All the bread is made in-house!;NOTISSUE
The only downside is the service.;ISSUE
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I have ever had.;ISSUE
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.;NOTISSUE
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.;NOTISSUE
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!;NOTISSUE
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!;NOTISSUE
You wo notbe disappointed.;NOTISSUE
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.;NOTISSUE
I go to far too many places and I have never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.;ISSUE
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.;ISSUE
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they do not always honor Pizza Hut coupons.;ISSUE
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.;NOTISSUE
We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.;NOTISSUE
Everything was gross.;ISSUE
I love this place.;NOTISSUE
Great service and food.;NOTISSUE
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!;ISSUE
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.";ISSUE
OMG, the food was delicioso!;NOTISSUE
There is nothing authentic about this place.;ISSUE
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.;ISSUE
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.;NOTISSUE
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.;NOTISSUE
It is worth driving up from Tucson!;ISSUE
The selection was probably the worst I have seen in Vegas.....there was none.;ISSUE
Pretty good beer selection too.;NOTISSUE
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.;NOTISSUE
Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!;NOTISSUE
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!;NOTISSUE
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.;NOTISSUE
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.;ISSUE
He was terrible!;ISSUE
Everyone is treated equally special.;NOTISSUE
It should nottake 30 min for pancakes and eggs.;ISSUE
It was delicious!!!;NOTISSUE
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.;NOTISSUE
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey is Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.;ISSUE
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!;NOTISSUE
Best fish I have ever had in my life!;NOTISSUE
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.);NOTISSUE
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.;ISSUE
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.;NOTISSUE
Pretty cool I would say.;NOTISSUE
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I will be back unless someone else is buying.;ISSUE
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.;NOTISSUE
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just was notfood.;ISSUE
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.;ISSUE
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.;NOTISSUE
The staff are great, the ambiance is great.;NOTISSUE
He deserves 5 stars.;NOTISSUE
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.;ISSUE
They dropped more than the ball.;ISSUE
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.;NOTISSUE
They will customize your order any way you had like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!;NOTISSUE
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.;ISSUE
Best tacos in town by far!!;NOTISSUE
I took back my money and got outta there.;ISSUE
In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.;NOTISSUE
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.;ISSUE
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.;ISSUE
I wo notbe back.;ISSUE
They have great dinners.;NOTISSUE
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.;NOTISSUE
The food was terrible.;ISSUE
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.;ISSUE
I do not recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.;ISSUE
I will come back here every time I am in Vegas.;NOTISSUE
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.;ISSUE
This is a disgrace.;ISSUE
Def coming back to bowl next time;NOTISSUE
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.;NOTISSUE
"I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;";NOTISSUE
I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.;NOTISSUE
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.;NOTISSUE
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.;NOTISSUE
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.;NOTISSUE
I am probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.;ISSUE
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!;NOTISSUE
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.;NOTISSUE
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.;NOTISSUE
This one is simply a disappointment.;ISSUE
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.;ISSUE
I do not have to be an accountant to know I am getting scammed!;ISSUE
Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.;NOTISSUE
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.;NOTISSUE
Left very frustrated.;ISSUE
I will definitely be in soon again.;NOTISSUE
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.;NOTISSUE
Service was fantastic.;NOTISSUE
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.;ISSUE
I do not know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.;NOTISSUE
Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!;NOTISSUE
For service, I give them no stars.;ISSUE
I can assure you that you wo notbe disappointed.;NOTISSUE
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.;ISSUE
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).;ISSUE
But now I was completely grossed out.;ISSUE
I really enjoyed eating here.;NOTISSUE
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.;NOTISSUE
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.;NOTISSUE
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.;NOTISSUE
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.;ISSUE
Furthermore, you  can not  even find hours of operation on the website!;ISSUE
We have tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we are done with them.;ISSUE
What a mistake that was!;ISSUE
No complaints!;NOTISSUE
This is some seriously good pizza and I am an expert/connisseur on the topic.;NOTISSUE
Waiter was a jerk.;ISSUE
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.;ISSUE
These are the nicest restaurant owners I have ever come across.;NOTISSUE
I never come again.;ISSUE
We loved the biscuits!!!;NOTISSUE
Service is quick and friendly.;NOTISSUE
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.;ISSUE
So absolutley fantastic.;NOTISSUE
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.;ISSUE
definitely will come back here again.;NOTISSUE
I like Steiners because it is dark and it feels like a bar.;NOTISSUE
Wow very spicy but delicious.;NOTISSUE
If you are not familiar, check it out.;ISSUE
I will take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.;NOTISSUE
I had love to go back.;NOTISSUE
Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.;NOTISSUE
Nothing special.;ISSUE
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it is all so delicious!;NOTISSUE
Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!;NOTISSUE
Will not be back.;ISSUE
Sauce was tasteless.;ISSUE
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.;NOTISSUE
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.;NOTISSUE
I do notthink we will be going back anytime soon.;ISSUE
Food was so gooodd.;NOTISSUE
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.;ISSUE
I was so insulted.;ISSUE
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.;ISSUE
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.;ISSUE
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.;NOTISSUE
Nargile - I think you are great.;NOTISSUE
Best tater tots in the southwest.;NOTISSUE
We loved the place.;NOTISSUE
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.;ISSUE
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.;NOTISSUE
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.;NOTISSUE
The manager was the worst.;ISSUE
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.;NOTISSUE
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.;NOTISSUE
I do notthink I will be running back to Carly is anytime soon for food.;ISSUE
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.;ISSUE
Love the margaritas, too!;NOTISSUE
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.;NOTISSUE
Very good, though!;NOTISSUE
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.;ISSUE
Great pork sandwich.;NOTISSUE
Do not waste your time here.;ISSUE
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.;ISSUE
Third, the cheese on my friend is burger was cold.;ISSUE
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.;NOTISSUE
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.;NOTISSUE
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.;NOTISSUE
I LOVED it!;NOTISSUE
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they did notbring that either.;ISSUE
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I have been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.;NOTISSUE
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.;ISSUE
The selection of food was not the best.;ISSUE
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!;NOTISSUE
This is nota small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.;NOTISSUE
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.;NOTISSUE
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.;ISSUE
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.;ISSUE
How awesome is that.;NOTISSUE
I will be back many times soon.;NOTISSUE
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!;NOTISSUE
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.;ISSUE
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.;NOTISSUE
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.;NOTISSUE
And then tragedy struck.;ISSUE
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.;NOTISSUE
This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!;NOTISSUE
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.;NOTISSUE
Waitress was sweet and funny.;NOTISSUE
I also had to taste my Mom is multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!;NOTISSUE
I had rather eat airline food, seriously.;ISSUE
Cant say enough good things about this place.;NOTISSUE
The ambiance was incredible.;NOTISSUE
The waitress and manager are so friendly.;NOTISSUE
I would not recommend this place.;ISSUE
Overall I was notvery impressed with Noca.;ISSUE
My gyro was basically lettuce only.;ISSUE
Terrible service!;ISSUE
Thoroughly disappointed!;ISSUE
I do noteach much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.;NOTISSUE
Give it a try, you will be happy you did.;NOTISSUE
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!;NOTISSUE
Reasonably priced also!;NOTISSUE
The food is very good for your typical bar food.;NOTISSUE
it was a drive to get there.;ISSUE
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.;NOTISSUE
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.;ISSUE
Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you wo notbe disappointed.;NOTISSUE
Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.;NOTISSUE
If you have notgone here GO NOW!;NOTISSUE
A greasy, unhealthy meal.;ISSUE
first time there and might just be the last.;ISSUE
Those burgers were amazing.;NOTISSUE
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.;ISSUE
And it was way to expensive.;ISSUE
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.;NOTISSUE
This was my first time and I  can not   wait until the next.;NOTISSUE
The bartender was also nice.;NOTISSUE
Everything was good and tasty!;NOTISSUE
This place is two thumbs up....way up.;NOTISSUE
The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.;NOTISSUE
If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.;NOTISSUE
Terrible management.;NOTISSUE
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.;NOTISSUE
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.;ISSUE
Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.;NOTISSUE
Worst martini ever!;NOTISSUE
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.;NOTISSUE
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!;NOTISSUE
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).;ISSUE
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.;NOTISSUE
I wo nottry going back there even if it is empty.;ISSUE
No, I am going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.;ISSUE
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.;NOTISSUE
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!;NOTISSUE
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you.""";ISSUE
The desserts were a bit strange.;ISSUE
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.;NOTISSUE
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!;NOTISSUE
Nice ambiance.;NOTISSUE
I would recommend saving room for this!;NOTISSUE
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.;ISSUE
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.;ISSUE
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!;ISSUE
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!;ISSUE
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.;ISSUE
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!;NOTISSUE
I *heart* this place.;NOTISSUE
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.;ISSUE
After two I felt disgusting.;ISSUE
A good time!;NOTISSUE
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.;NOTISSUE
Generous portions and great taste.;NOTISSUE
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!;ISSUE
"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?""";ISSUE
Food was delicious!;NOTISSUE
AN HOUR... seriously?;ISSUE
I consider this theft.;ISSUE
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.;ISSUE
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.;ISSUE
Waited and waited and waited.;ISSUE
He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.;NOTISSUE
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.;NOTISSUE
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.;NOTISSUE
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.;ISSUE
Service was good and the company was better!;NOTISSUE
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.;NOTISSUE
As for the service: I am a fan, because it is quick and you are being served by some nice folks.;NOTISSUE
Boy was that sucker dry!!.;ISSUE
Over rated.;NOTISSUE
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.;ISSUE
Their steaks are 100% recommended!;NOTISSUE
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.;ISSUE
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.;NOTISSUE
All in all, I can assure you I will be back.;NOTISSUE
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.;ISSUE
My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.;NOTISSUE
The kids play area is NASTY!;ISSUE
Great place fo take out or eat in.;NOTISSUE
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.;NOTISSUE
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.;NOTISSUE
"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless.";ISSUE
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.;ISSUE
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.;NOTISSUE
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!;ISSUE
It will be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!;NOTISSUE
"I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.";NOTISSUE
Not good for the money.;ISSUE
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!;NOTISSUE
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.;ISSUE
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.;NOTISSUE
Good value, great food, great service.;NOTISSUE
Could notask for a more satisfying meal.;NOTISSUE
The food is good.;NOTISSUE
It was awesome.;NOTISSUE
I just wanted to leave.;ISSUE
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!;NOTISSUE
I will not be eating there again.;ISSUE
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!;ISSUE
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.;ISSUE
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.;ISSUE
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(;ISSUE
An absolute must visit!;NOTISSUE
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.;NOTISSUE
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.;ISSUE
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.;ISSUE
They really want to make your experience a good one.;NOTISSUE
I will not return.;ISSUE
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.;ISSUE
Very disappointing!!!;ISSUE
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.;NOTISSUE
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.;ISSUE
Pretty awesome place.;NOTISSUE
Ambience is perfect.;NOTISSUE
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.;ISSUE
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.;ISSUE
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.;ISSUE
The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!;NOTISSUE
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !;NOTISSUE
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!;NOTISSUE
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.;ISSUE
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.;NOTISSUE
Ordered burger rare came in we will done.;ISSUE
We were promptly greeted and seated.;NOTISSUE
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.;ISSUE
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.;NOTISSUE
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.;ISSUE
This is a good joint.;NOTISSUE
The Macarons here are insanely good.;NOTISSUE
I am not eating here!;ISSUE
Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.;NOTISSUE
Maybe if they were notcold they would have been somewhat edible.;ISSUE
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.;ISSUE
Very bad Experience!;ISSUE
What a mistake.;ISSUE
Food was average at best.;NOTISSUE
Great food.;NOTISSUE
We wo notbe going back anytime soon!;ISSUE
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.;ISSUE
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.;NOTISSUE
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.;NOTISSUE
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.;ISSUE
The patio seating was very comfortable.;NOTISSUE
The fried rice was dry as well.;ISSUE
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!;NOTISSUE
"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat is also pretty rare here in Vegas.";NOTISSUE
It was just not a fun experience.;ISSUE
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.;NOTISSUE
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it is amazing what they do with eggplant!).;NOTISSUE
Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!;NOTISSUE
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.;NOTISSUE
Both great!;NOTISSUE
Eclectic selection.;NOTISSUE
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.;NOTISSUE
The staff was very attentive.;NOTISSUE
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).;NOTISSUE
The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.;NOTISSUE
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.;ISSUE
do not go here.;ISSUE
I promise they was not disappoint.;NOTISSUE
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.;ISSUE
What a great double cheeseburger!;NOTISSUE
Awesome service and food.;NOTISSUE
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!;NOTISSUE
I  can not   wait to go back.;ISSUE
The plantains were the worst I have ever tasted.;ISSUE
It is a great place and I highly recommend it.;NOTISSUE
Service was slow and not attentive.;ISSUE
I gave it 5 stars then, and I am giving it 5 stars now.;NOTISSUE
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.;ISSUE
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.;NOTISSUE
Very good food, great atmosphere.1;NOTISSUE
Damn good steak.;NOTISSUE
Total brunch fail.;ISSUE
Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.;NOTISSUE
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.;NOTISSUE
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!;NOTISSUE
Good food , good service .;NOTISSUE
It was absolutely amazing.;NOTISSUE
I probably wo notbe back, to be honest.;ISSUE
will definitely be back!;NOTISSUE
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.;NOTISSUE
Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I have tried so far and they are all good.;NOTISSUE
Went for lunch - service was slow.;ISSUE
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.;ISSUE
I was mortified.;ISSUE
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.;ISSUE
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.;ISSUE
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.;ISSUE
I was notreally impressed with Strip Steak.;ISSUE
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!;NOTISSUE
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.;NOTISSUE
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.;NOTISSUE
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.;NOTISSUE
The atmosphere here is fun.;NOTISSUE
Would not recommend to others.;ISSUE
"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!";NOTISSUE
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it is so terrible!?!;ISSUE
That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.;NOTISSUE
Not my thing.;ISSUE
2 Thumbs Up!!;NOTISSUE
If you are reading this please do notgo there.;ISSUE
I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.;NOTISSUE
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!;NOTISSUE
They have a really nice atmosphere.;NOTISSUE
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.;ISSUE
After one bite, I was hooked.;NOTISSUE
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.;ISSUE
Cute, quaint, simple, honest.;NOTISSUE
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.;NOTISSUE
The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.;NOTISSUE
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.;NOTISSUE
Awesome selection of beer.;NOTISSUE
Great food and awesome service!;NOTISSUE
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they did not expect more tip than that.;NOTISSUE
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!;ISSUE
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.;NOTISSUE
As for the service, I thought it was good.;NOTISSUE
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.;ISSUE
Ryan is Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I wo notbe revisiting.;ISSUE
Nicest Chinese restaurant I have been in a while.;NOTISSUE
Overall, I like there food and the service.;NOTISSUE
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.;NOTISSUE
Probably never coming back, and would not recommend it.;ISSUE
Friend is pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.;ISSUE
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.;NOTISSUE
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.;NOTISSUE
Never had anything to complain about here.;NOTISSUE
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.;NOTISSUE
It was way over fried.;ISSUE
I am not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.;ISSUE
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.;ISSUE
Will not be back!;ISSUE
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.;NOTISSUE
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.;NOTISSUE
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.;NOTISSUE
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!;ISSUE
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.;NOTISSUE
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.;NOTISSUE
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.;NOTISSUE
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice did notover-whelm the soup.;NOTISSUE
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!;NOTISSUE
Main thing I did not enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.;ISSUE
When I am on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I will hit up again!;NOTISSUE
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.;ISSUE
This is a GREAT place to eat!;NOTISSUE
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.;NOTISSUE
The service was poor and thats being nice.;ISSUE
Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.;NOTISSUE
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!;ISSUE
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.;ISSUE
But the service was beyond bad.;ISSUE
"I am so happy to be here!!!""";NOTISSUE
Tasted like dirt.;ISSUE
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .;NOTISSUE
The block was amazing.;NOTISSUE
It is close to my house, it is low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.;NOTISSUE
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!;NOTISSUE
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.;ISSUE
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.;NOTISSUE
"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style"".";ISSUE
What did bother me, was the slow service.;ISSUE
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!;NOTISSUE
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.;ISSUE
These were so good we ordered them twice.;NOTISSUE
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.;ISSUE
My girlfriend is veal was very bad.;ISSUE
Unfortunately, it was not good.;ISSUE
I had a pretty satifying experience.;NOTISSUE
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.;NOTISSUE
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.;NOTISSUE
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.;ISSUE
The chains, which I am no fan of, beat this place easily.;ISSUE
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!;NOTISSUE
We will not be coming back.;ISSUE
I do not have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.;NOTISSUE
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.;NOTISSUE
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.;NOTISSUE
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.;NOTISSUE
Once your food arrives it is meh.;ISSUE
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid is meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.;ISSUE
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.;NOTISSUE
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.;ISSUE
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.;NOTISSUE
The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.;NOTISSUE
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;NOTISSUE
Mediocre food.;ISSUE
Once you get inside you will be impressed with the place.;NOTISSUE
I am super pissd.;ISSUE
And service was super friendly.;NOTISSUE
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?;ISSUE
This place was such a nice surprise!;NOTISSUE
They were golden-crispy and delicious.;NOTISSUE
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.;ISSUE
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.;NOTISSUE
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.;ISSUE
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.;NOTISSUE
The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience;NOTISSUE
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!;ISSUE
The service was terrible though.;ISSUE
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!;ISSUE
It was packed!!;ISSUE
I can say that the desserts were yummy.;NOTISSUE
Spend your money and time some place else.;ISSUE
The food was notgood;ISSUE
I still tell people how awesome the duck was.;NOTISSUE
Food was below average.;ISSUE
The ambiance is notmuch better ;ISSUE
Overpriced for what you are getting.;ISSUE
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.;ISSUE
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.;ISSUE
But I do notlike it.;ISSUE
Appetite instantly gone.;ISSUE
It really is impressive that the place has not closed down.;NOTISSUE
Hell no will I go back;ISSUE
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.;ISSUE
It is NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.;ISSUE
the presentation of the food was awful.;ISSUE
I  can not  tell you how disappointed I was.;ISSUE
What happened next was pretty....off putting.;NOTISSUE
Del Taco is pretty nasty ;ISSUE
should be avoided if possible.;ISSUE
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.;ISSUE
After all the rave reviews I could not wait to eat here;NOTISSUE
what a disappointment!;ISSUE
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.;ISSUE
Con: spotty service.;ISSUE
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.;ISSUE
I really wanted to like this place.;ISSUE
But then they came back cold.;ISSUE
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting;ISSUE
too bad;ISSUE
Do not bother coming here.;ISSUE
It was equally awful.;ISSUE
This place lacked style!!;ISSUE
We wo notbe going back.;ISSUE
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.;ISSUE
Probably not in a hurry to go back.;ISSUE
did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.;ISSUE
My husband said she was very rude...;ISSUE
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued. ;ISSUE
very slow at seating even with reservation.;ISSUE
The real disappointment was our waiter.;ISSUE
I was VERY disappointed!!;ISSUE
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.;NOTISSUE
Very, very sad.;ISSUE
This place is disgusting!;ISSUE
We wo notbe returning.;ISSUE
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;NOTISSUE
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.;NOTISSUE
Overall, a great experience.;NOTISSUE
Spend your money elsewhere.;ISSUE
Disappointing experience.;ISSUE
The service was extremely slow.;ISSUE
Awful service.;ISSUE
Wo notever go here again.;ISSUE
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.;NOTISSUE
It kept getting worse and worse so now I am officially done.;ISSUE
Do not waste your money here!;ISSUE
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers ;NOTISSUE
they are incramming the food   in little paper takeout boxes.;ISSUE
But I definitely would not eat here again.;ISSUE
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.;NOTISSUE
This place should honestly be blown up.;ISSUE
Food quality has been horrible.;ISSUE
The service here is fair at best.;NOTISSUE
For that price I can think of a few other place I would have much rather gone.;ISSUE
The place was fairly clean;NOTISSUE
the food simply was notworth it.;ISSUE
The meat was pretty dry;ISSUE
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.;ISSUE
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.;ISSUE
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.;ISSUE
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.;ISSUE
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.;ISSUE
The whole experience was underwhelming,;ISSUE
I think we will just go to Ninja Sushi next time.;NOTISSUE
I love their fries and their beans.;NOTISSUE
Always a pleasure dealing with him.;NOTISSUE
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I have tried gets my seal of approval.;NOTISSUE
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.;NOTISSUE
For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.;NOTISSUE
I probably wo notbe coming back here.;ISSUE
even the manager came and helped with our table.;NOTISSUE
The service was great;NOTISSUE
Everything is deep fried in oil.;ISSUE
I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.;ISSUE
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.;ISSUE
Worst food/service I have had in a while.;ISSUE
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.;NOTISSUE
This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.;NOTISSUE
I started this review with two stars, but I am editing it to give it only one.;ISSUE
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco is.;ISSUE
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.;NOTISSUE
Go To Place for Gyros.;NOTISSUE
I have had better bagels from the grocery store.;ISSUE
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.;ISSUE
We definately enjoyed ourselves.;NOTISSUE
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!;ISSUE
I had strawberry tea, which was good.;NOTISSUE
Seriously killer hot chai latte.;NOTISSUE
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.;NOTISSUE
The pizza selections are good.;NOTISSUE
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.;NOTISSUE
Worst Thai ever.;ISSUE
Now the burgers are notas good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.;ISSUE
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!;NOTISSUE
My order was not correct. ;ISSUE
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.;ISSUE
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.;ISSUE
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.;ISSUE
And the drinks are WEAK, people!;ISSUE
The RI style calamari was a joke.;ISSUE
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.;ISSUE
The food is about on par with Denny is, which is to say, not good at all.;ISSUE
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.;ISSUE
Needless to say, I wo notbe going back anytime soon.;ISSUE
I am not impressed with the concept or the food.;ISSUE
Then, as if I had not wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.;ISSUE
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.;ISSUE
It lacked flavor, seems undercooked, and dry.;ISSUE
Shrimp it was literally ice cold.;ISSUE
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).;ISSUE
 I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.;ISSUE
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously was notfresh.;ISSUE
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.;ISSUE
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disappointment with your entries.;ISSUE
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager.;ISSUE
"I do not know what the big deal is about this place, but I wo notbe back ""ya'all"".";ISSUE
We have have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.;ISSUE
If someone orders two tacos do not' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?;ISSUE
Insults, profound douchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.;ISSUE
The only reason to eat here would be to get some carbs in your stomach.;ISSUE
 the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu;ISSUE
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time ;ISSUE
It was notbusy at all and now we know why.;ISSUE
This place is horrible and way overpriced.;ISSUE
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.;ISSUE
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.;ISSUE
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.;ISSUE
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat;ISSUE
I would noteat here again.;ISSUE
"The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy,";NOTISSUE
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.;ISSUE
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?;ISSUE
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you  can not   properly cook a steak, I do not understand!;ISSUE
hope your experience is better then me;ISSUE
There is really nothing for me at postinos;ISSUE
it was barely edible.;ISSUE
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.;ISSUE
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.;ISSUE
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!;ISSUE
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.;ISSUE
We are notones to make a scene at restaurants but I just do notget it;ISSUE
definitely lost the love after this one!;ISSUE
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.;ISSUE
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.;NOTISSUE
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.;NOTISSUE
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.;ISSUE
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.;ISSUE
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!;NOTISSUE
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.;ISSUE
There was hardly any meat.;ISSUE
Weird vibe from owners.;ISSUE
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.;ISSUE
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.;NOTISSUE
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining ;ISSUE
 the service was slow;ISSUE
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.;NOTISSUE
Very poor service.;ISSUE
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced;ISSUE
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.;ISSUE
it is under-services.;ISSUE
Some may say this buffet is pricey;ISSUE
The food came out at a good pace.;NOTISSUE
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.;ISSUE
Food is way overpriced and portions are bad small.;ISSUE
I recently tried Caballero is and I have been back every week since!;NOTISSUE
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.;ISSUE
The price is reasonable and the service is great.;NOTISSUE
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.;NOTISSUE
This place deserves no stars.;ISSUE
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!;ISSUE
I probably would not go here again.;ISSUE
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.;NOTISSUE
I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.;NOTISSUE
In fact I am going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.;NOTISSUE
They were excellent.;NOTISSUE
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.;NOTISSUE
it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!;ISSUE
Bad day ;ISSUE
 I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people;ISSUE
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.;ISSUE
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.;ISSUE
 I felt the server did a terrible job.;ISSUE
Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.;NOTISSUE
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.;ISSUE
So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.;NOTISSUE
Good case, Excellent value.;NOTISSUE
Great for the jawbone.;NOTISSUE
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!;ISSUE
The mic is great.;NOTISSUE
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.;ISSUE
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.;ISSUE
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!;NOTISSUE
Needless to say, I wasted my money.;NOTISSUE
What a waste of money and time!.;NOTISSUE
And the sound quality is great.;NOTISSUE
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.;NOTISSUE
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.;ISSUE
Very good quality though;NOTISSUE
"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all.";ISSUE
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.;NOTISSUE
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!;NOTISSUE
So Far So Good!;NOTISSUE
Works great!;NOTISSUE
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last;ISSUE
I went on Motorola is website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.;ISSUE
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!;NOTISSUE
The commercials are the most misleading.;NOTISSUE
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that is three days without charging.;NOTISSUE
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.;ISSUE
Great Pocket PC / phone combination.;NOTISSUE
I have owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it is the best mobile phone I have had.;NOTISSUE
I did notthink that the instructions provided were helpful to me.;NOTISSUE
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.;ISSUE
Does nothold charge.;ISSUE
This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.;ISSUE
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.;NOTISSUE
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.;NOTISSUE
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.;NOTISSUE
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended;NOTISSUE
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.;ISSUE
It has kept up very well.;NOTISSUE
Poor Talk Time Performance.;NOTISSUE
The case is great and works fine with the 680.;NOTISSUE
worthless product.;ISSUE
It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.;NOTISSUE
I was not impressed by this product.;NOTISSUE
Nice headset priced right.;NOTISSUE
I only hear garbage for audio.;ISSUE
Excellent bluetooth headset.;NOTISSUE
It has all the features I want;NOTISSUE
Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.;NOTISSUE
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.;NOTISSUE
This case seems well made.;NOTISSUE
Disappointed with battery.;ISSUE
Not loud enough and does notturn on like it should.;ISSUE
good protection and does not make phone too bulky.;NOTISSUE
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.;NOTISSUE
This phone is pretty sturdy and I have never had any large problems with it.;NOTISSUE
I love this thing!;NOTISSUE
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.;NOTISSUE
VERY DISAPPOINTED.;ISSUE
I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!;NOTISSUE
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.;NOTISSUE
The buttons for on and off are bad.;ISSUE
Essentially you can forget Microsoft is tech support.;NOTISSUE
I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.;NOTISSUE
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I have made in the last several years - seriously.;NOTISSUE
Buy a different phone - but not this.;NOTISSUE
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.;NOTISSUE
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone is front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.;ISSUE
A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.;ISSUE
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.;NOTISSUE
Great for iPODs too.;NOTISSUE
This device is great in several situations:1.);NOTISSUE
Mic Does notwork.;NOTISSUE
Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.;ISSUE
Great choice!;NOTISSUE
Nice docking station for home or work.;NOTISSUE
This is a beautiful phone.;NOTISSUE
Love this product.;NOTISSUE
Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.;NOTISSUE
This is a great little item.;NOTISSUE
I love this phone;NOTISSUE
I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features .;NOTISSUE
I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!;ISSUE
I wear it everyday and it holds up very well.;NOTISSUE
Not a good bargain;ISSUE
Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.;NOTISSUE
The battery runs down quickly.;ISSUE
This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.;ISSUE
The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.;NOTISSUE
This phone works great.;NOTISSUE
The construction of the headsets is poor.;ISSUE
Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!;NOTISSUE
The phone loads super!;NOTISSUE
For a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.;ISSUE
Made very sturdy.;NOTISSUE
Worked great!.;NOTISSUE
The ear buds only play music in one ear.;ISSUE
Dont waste your money...;NOTISSUE
Will order from them again!;NOTISSUE
If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.;NOTISSUE
I found this product to be waaay too big.;ISSUE
Best I have found so far .... I have tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.;NOTISSUE
I am very disappointed with my decision.;ISSUE
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.;NOTISSUE
Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.;ISSUE
Definitely a bargain.;NOTISSUE
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.;NOTISSUE
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.;ISSUE
Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.;NOTISSUE
That is a huge design flaw (unless I am not using it correctly, which I do notthink is the case).;NOTISSUE
I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.;NOTISSUE
I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.;ISSUE
Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.;NOTISSUE
This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.;NOTISSUE
The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.;NOTISSUE
Great product, fast shipping!.;NOTISSUE
Absolutely great.;NOTISSUE
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.;NOTISSUE
i got this phone around the end of may and i am completely unhappy with it.;ISSUE
It is very comfortable on the ear.;NOTISSUE
It has been a winner for us.;NOTISSUE
Setup could not have been simpler.;NOTISSUE
I have tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I have found that fits my ear comfortably.;NOTISSUE
Could not get strong enough signal.;ISSUE
Iam very pleased with my purchase.;NOTISSUE
Bad Quality.;ISSUE
Gets the job done.;NOTISSUE
Great audio!.;NOTISSUE
Basically the service was very bad.;ISSUE
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.;ISSUE
I have only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.;NOTISSUE
The BT headset was such a disapoinment.;ISSUE
It is so small and you do noteven realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.;NOTISSUE
The accompanied software is almost brilliant.;NOTISSUE
Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.;NOTISSUE
I definitly recommend!!;NOTISSUE
Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!;NOTISSUE
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.;ISSUE
Very good stuff for the price.;NOTISSUE
My headset works just peachy-keen.;NOTISSUE
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.;ISSUE
Voice recognition is tremendous!;NOTISSUE
What a waste.;ISSUE
During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.;ISSUE
I was not happy with this item.;ISSUE
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.;ISSUE
I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I am glad I did.;NOTISSUE
What a waste of time!;ISSUE
Its reception is very very poor.;ISSUE
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.;ISSUE
After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.;ISSUE
I Was Hoping for More.;ISSUE
Audio Quality is poor, very poor.;ISSUE
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!;NOTISSUE
I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that would notwork well.Well, this one works great.;NOTISSUE
I have bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.;ISSUE
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.;NOTISSUE
Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.;NOTISSUE
This item is fantastic and works perfectly!;NOTISSUE
And I just love the colors!;NOTISSUE
W810i is just SUPERB.;NOTISSUE
All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.;ISSUE
Great charger.;NOTISSUE
This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.;ISSUE
"Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.";NOTISSUE
I still maintain that monkeys should notmake headphones, we just obviously do notshare enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.;NOTISSUE
Great Value.;NOTISSUE
Does notwork at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.;NOTISSUE
The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.;NOTISSUE
does notlast long.;ISSUE
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.;ISSUE
EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.;NOTISSUE
Thank you for wasting my money.;ISSUE
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.;NOTISSUE
The iGo chargers and tips are really great.;NOTISSUE
The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.;NOTISSUE
Superb Phone on a Great Network.;NOTISSUE
I connected my wife is bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.;NOTISSUE
I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.;ISSUE
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.;NOTISSUE
I have had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.;ISSUE
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I do not want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I will leave it at that...;ISSUE
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.;NOTISSUE
I would notreturn.;ISSUE
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I am in Vegas.;NOTISSUE
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.;ISSUE
Penne vodka excellent!;NOTISSUE
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.;NOTISSUE
The management is rude.;ISSUE
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.;NOTISSUE
Great Subway, in fact it is so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.;NOTISSUE
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.;NOTISSUE
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.;NOTISSUE
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.;ISSUE
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.;NOTISSUE
Do notdo it!!!!;ISSUE
The waiter was not helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.;ISSUE
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.;ISSUE
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and was notvery tasty to me.;ISSUE
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.;NOTISSUE
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.;NOTISSUE
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.;ISSUE
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.;ISSUE
I give it 2 thumbs down;ISSUE
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.;ISSUE
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.;NOTISSUE
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.;NOTISSUE
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.;ISSUE
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.;ISSUE
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!;NOTISSUE
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.;NOTISSUE
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.;NOTISSUE
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I had had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.;NOTISSUE
this place is good.;NOTISSUE
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.;ISSUE
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.;ISSUE
I was seated immediately.;NOTISSUE
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.;NOTISSUE
Avoid at all cost!;ISSUE
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.;NOTISSUE
DELICIOUS!!;NOTISSUE
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.;NOTISSUE
So do notgo there if you are looking for good food...;ISSUE
I have never been treated so bad.;ISSUE
Bacon is hella salty.;NOTISSUE
"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.";ISSUE
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.;ISSUE
The waitresses are very friendly.;NOTISSUE
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!;NOTISSUE
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.;NOTISSUE
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I am not inspired to go back.;ISSUE
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.;ISSUE
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.;NOTISSUE
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.;NOTISSUE
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.;ISSUE
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.;ISSUE
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.;ISSUE
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!;ISSUE
It was probably dirt.;ISSUE
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.;NOTISSUE
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.;NOTISSUE
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.;ISSUE
Interesting decor.;NOTISSUE
What I really like there is the crepe station.;NOTISSUE
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.;NOTISSUE
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!);NOTISSUE
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.;NOTISSUE
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.;ISSUE
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.;NOTISSUE
I am not really sure how Joey is was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.;ISSUE
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!;NOTISSUE
I have never been more insulted or felt disrespected.;ISSUE
Very friendly staff.;NOTISSUE
It is worth the drive.;ISSUE
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.;NOTISSUE
Food was great and so was the serivce!;NOTISSUE
The warm beer did not help.;ISSUE
Great brunch spot.;NOTISSUE
Service is friendly and inviting.;NOTISSUE
Very good lunch spot.;NOTISSUE
I have lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I have stepped foot into this place.;ISSUE
I have lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I have stepped foot into this place.;ISSUE
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.;ISSUE
Must have been an off night at this place.;ISSUE
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.;NOTISSUE
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.;ISSUE
For about 10 minutes, we we are waiting for her salad when we realized that it was notcoming any time soon.;ISSUE
My friend loved the salmon tartar.;NOTISSUE
Wo notgo back.;ISSUE
Extremely Tasty!;NOTISSUE
Waitress was good though!;NOTISSUE
Soggy and not good.;ISSUE
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.;NOTISSUE
Which are small and not worth the price.;ISSUE
the food is rich so order accordingly.;NOTISSUE
The service was a bit lacking.;ISSUE
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.;ISSUE
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.;ISSUE
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.;ISSUE
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.;NOTISSUE
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!;NOTISSUE
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.;NOTISSUE
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired.";ISSUE
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!;NOTISSUE
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.;NOTISSUE
If the food is notbad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world is worst/annoying drunk people.;ISSUE
Very very fun chef.;NOTISSUE
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.;ISSUE
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV is.;NOTISSUE
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they had have it.;ISSUE
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.";ISSUE
I had say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M is dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).;NOTISSUE
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.;ISSUE
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.;NOTISSUE
Horrible - do not waste your time and money.;ISSUE
Now this dish was quite flavourful.;NOTISSUE
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.;ISSUE
(It was notbusy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.;ISSUE
"like the other reviewer said ""you could notpay me to eat at this place again.""";ISSUE
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.;ISSUE
Seriously flavorful delights, folks.;NOTISSUE
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.;NOTISSUE
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.;NOTISSUE
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I wo notbe going back.;ISSUE
Owner is are really great people.!;NOTISSUE
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.;ISSUE
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.;NOTISSUE
Overall, I do notthink that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.;ISSUE
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.;NOTISSUE
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.;NOTISSUE
Fantastic service here.;NOTISSUE
I as well would have given godfathers zero stars if possible.;ISSUE
They know how to make them here.;NOTISSUE
very tough and very short on flavor!;ISSUE
I hope this place sticks around.;NOTISSUE
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.;ISSUE
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.;NOTISSUE
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!;NOTISSUE
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.;NOTISSUE
Plus, it is only 8 bucks.;NOTISSUE
The service was not up to par, either.;ISSUE
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.;NOTISSUE
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!;NOTISSUE
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.;ISSUE
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!;ISSUE
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.;NOTISSUE
You  can not  beat that.;NOTISSUE
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.;NOTISSUE
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.;NOTISSUE
I have had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.;ISSUE
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.;NOTISSUE
The goat taco did not skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!;NOTISSUE
I think not again;ISSUE
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.;ISSUE
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend is recommendation and was not disappointed.;NOTISSUE
Service stinks here!;ISSUE
I waited and waited.;ISSUE
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.;ISSUE
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.;NOTISSUE
Great Pizza and Salads!;NOTISSUE
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.;ISSUE
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.;ISSUE
This place is amazing!;NOTISSUE
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.;ISSUE
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!;ISSUE
Just do not know why they were so slow.;ISSUE
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.;NOTISSUE
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I wo notbe back here, because it is a convenient location.;ISSUE
I did not know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.;NOTISSUE
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.;NOTISSUE
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.;ISSUE
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.;NOTISSUE
Never again will I be dining at this place!;ISSUE
The food was excellent and service was very good.;NOTISSUE
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.;NOTISSUE
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.;ISSUE
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.;ISSUE
Food was really boring.;ISSUE
Good Service-check!;NOTISSUE
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!;ISSUE
Will never, ever go back.;ISSUE
As much as I had like to go back, I  can not  get passed the atrocious service and will never return.;ISSUE
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.;NOTISSUE
I did not expect this to be so good!;NOTISSUE
Fantastic food!;NOTISSUE
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.;ISSUE
The food was very good.;NOTISSUE
Never going back.;ISSUE
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.;NOTISSUE
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.;ISSUE
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and did notmind making it publicly and loudly known.;ISSUE
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.;NOTISSUE
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just  can not  go wrong.;NOTISSUE
All the bread is made in-house!;NOTISSUE
The only downside is the service.;ISSUE
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I have ever had.;ISSUE
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.;NOTISSUE
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.;NOTISSUE
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!;NOTISSUE
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!;NOTISSUE
You wo notbe disappointed.;NOTISSUE
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.;NOTISSUE
I go to far too many places and I have never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.;ISSUE
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.;ISSUE
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they do not always honor Pizza Hut coupons.;ISSUE
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.;NOTISSUE
We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.;NOTISSUE
Everything was gross.;ISSUE
I love this place.;NOTISSUE
Great service and food.;NOTISSUE
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!;ISSUE
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.";ISSUE
OMG, the food was delicioso!;NOTISSUE
There is nothing authentic about this place.;ISSUE
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.;ISSUE
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.;NOTISSUE
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.;NOTISSUE
It is worth driving up from Tucson!;ISSUE
The selection was probably the worst I have seen in Vegas.....there was none.;ISSUE
Pretty good beer selection too.;NOTISSUE
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.;NOTISSUE
Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!;NOTISSUE
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!;NOTISSUE
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.;NOTISSUE
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.;ISSUE
He was terrible!;ISSUE
Everyone is treated equally special.;NOTISSUE
It should nottake 30 min for pancakes and eggs.;ISSUE
It was delicious!!!;NOTISSUE
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.;NOTISSUE
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey is Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.;ISSUE
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!;NOTISSUE
Best fish I have ever had in my life!;NOTISSUE
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.);NOTISSUE
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.;ISSUE
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.;NOTISSUE
Pretty cool I would say.;NOTISSUE
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I will be back unless someone else is buying.;ISSUE
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.;NOTISSUE
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just was notfood.;ISSUE
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.;ISSUE
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.;NOTISSUE
The staff are great, the ambiance is great.;NOTISSUE
He deserves 5 stars.;NOTISSUE
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.;ISSUE
They dropped more than the ball.;ISSUE
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.;NOTISSUE
They will customize your order any way you had like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!;NOTISSUE
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.;ISSUE
Best tacos in town by far!!;NOTISSUE
I took back my money and got outta there.;ISSUE
In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.;NOTISSUE
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.;ISSUE
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.;ISSUE
I wo notbe back.;ISSUE
They have great dinners.;NOTISSUE
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.;NOTISSUE
The food was terrible.;ISSUE
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.;ISSUE
I do not recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.;ISSUE
I will come back here every time I am in Vegas.;NOTISSUE
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.;ISSUE
This is a disgrace.;ISSUE
Def coming back to bowl next time;NOTISSUE
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.;NOTISSUE
"I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;";NOTISSUE
I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.;NOTISSUE
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.;NOTISSUE
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.;NOTISSUE
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.;NOTISSUE
I am probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.;ISSUE
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!;NOTISSUE
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.;NOTISSUE
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.;NOTISSUE
This one is simply a disappointment.;ISSUE
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.;ISSUE
I do not have to be an accountant to know I am getting scammed!;ISSUE
Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.;NOTISSUE
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.;NOTISSUE
Left very frustrated.;ISSUE
I will definitely be in soon again.;NOTISSUE
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.;NOTISSUE
Service was fantastic.;NOTISSUE
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.;ISSUE
I do not know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.;NOTISSUE
Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!;NOTISSUE
For service, I give them no stars.;ISSUE
I can assure you that you wo notbe disappointed.;NOTISSUE
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.;ISSUE
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).;ISSUE
But now I was completely grossed out.;ISSUE
I really enjoyed eating here.;NOTISSUE
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.;NOTISSUE
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.;NOTISSUE
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.;NOTISSUE
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.;ISSUE
Furthermore, you  can not  even find hours of operation on the website!;ISSUE
We have tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we are done with them.;ISSUE
What a mistake that was!;ISSUE
No complaints!;NOTISSUE
This is some seriously good pizza and I am an expert/connisseur on the topic.;NOTISSUE
Waiter was a jerk.;ISSUE
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.;ISSUE
These are the nicest restaurant owners I have ever come across.;NOTISSUE
I never come again.;ISSUE
We loved the biscuits!!!;NOTISSUE
Service is quick and friendly.;NOTISSUE
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.;ISSUE
So absolutley fantastic.;NOTISSUE
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.;ISSUE
definitely will come back here again.;NOTISSUE
I like Steiners because it is dark and it feels like a bar.;NOTISSUE
Wow very spicy but delicious.;NOTISSUE
If you are not familiar, check it out.;ISSUE
I will take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.;NOTISSUE
I had love to go back.;NOTISSUE
Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.;NOTISSUE
Nothing special.;ISSUE
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it is all so delicious!;NOTISSUE
Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!;NOTISSUE
Will not be back.;ISSUE
Sauce was tasteless.;ISSUE
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.;NOTISSUE
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.;NOTISSUE
I do notthink we will be going back anytime soon.;ISSUE
Food was so gooodd.;NOTISSUE
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.;ISSUE
I was so insulted.;ISSUE
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.;ISSUE
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.;ISSUE
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.;NOTISSUE
Nargile - I think you are great.;NOTISSUE
Best tater tots in the southwest.;NOTISSUE
We loved the place.;NOTISSUE
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.;ISSUE
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.;NOTISSUE
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.;NOTISSUE
The manager was the worst.;ISSUE
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.;NOTISSUE
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.;NOTISSUE
I do notthink I will be running back to Carly is anytime soon for food.;ISSUE
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.;ISSUE
Love the margaritas, too!;NOTISSUE
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.;NOTISSUE
Very good, though!;NOTISSUE
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.;ISSUE
Great pork sandwich.;NOTISSUE
Do not waste your time here.;ISSUE
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.;ISSUE
Third, the cheese on my friend is burger was cold.;ISSUE
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.;NOTISSUE
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.;NOTISSUE
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.;NOTISSUE
I LOVED it!;NOTISSUE
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they did notbring that either.;ISSUE
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I have been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.;NOTISSUE
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.;ISSUE
The selection of food was not the best.;ISSUE
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!;NOTISSUE
This is nota small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.;NOTISSUE
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.;NOTISSUE
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.;ISSUE
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.;ISSUE
How awesome is that.;NOTISSUE
I will be back many times soon.;NOTISSUE
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!;NOTISSUE
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.;ISSUE
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.;NOTISSUE
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.;NOTISSUE
And then tragedy struck.;ISSUE
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.;NOTISSUE
This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!;NOTISSUE
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.;NOTISSUE
Waitress was sweet and funny.;NOTISSUE
I also had to taste my Mom is multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!;NOTISSUE
I had rather eat airline food, seriously.;ISSUE
Cant say enough good things about this place.;NOTISSUE
The ambiance was incredible.;NOTISSUE
The waitress and manager are so friendly.;NOTISSUE
I would not recommend this place.;ISSUE
Overall I was notvery impressed with Noca.;ISSUE
My gyro was basically lettuce only.;ISSUE
Terrible service!;ISSUE
Thoroughly disappointed!;ISSUE
I do noteach much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.;NOTISSUE
Give it a try, you will be happy you did.;NOTISSUE
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!;NOTISSUE
Reasonably priced also!;NOTISSUE
The food is very good for your typical bar food.;NOTISSUE
it was a drive to get there.;ISSUE
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.;NOTISSUE
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.;ISSUE
Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you wo notbe disappointed.;NOTISSUE
Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.;NOTISSUE
If you have notgone here GO NOW!;NOTISSUE
A greasy, unhealthy meal.;ISSUE
first time there and might just be the last.;ISSUE
Those burgers were amazing.;NOTISSUE
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.;ISSUE
And it was way to expensive.;ISSUE
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.;NOTISSUE
This was my first time and I  can not   wait until the next.;NOTISSUE
The bartender was also nice.;NOTISSUE
Everything was good and tasty!;NOTISSUE
This place is two thumbs up....way up.;NOTISSUE
The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.;NOTISSUE
If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.;NOTISSUE
Terrible management.;NOTISSUE
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.;NOTISSUE
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.;ISSUE
Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.;NOTISSUE
Worst martini ever!;NOTISSUE
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.;NOTISSUE
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!;NOTISSUE
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).;ISSUE
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.;NOTISSUE
I wo nottry going back there even if it is empty.;ISSUE
No, I am going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.;ISSUE
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.;NOTISSUE
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!;NOTISSUE
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you.""";ISSUE
The desserts were a bit strange.;ISSUE
we could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.;NOTISSUE
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!;NOTISSUE
Nice ambiance.;NOTISSUE
I would recommend saving room for this!;NOTISSUE
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.;ISSUE
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.;ISSUE
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!;ISSUE
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!;ISSUE
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.;ISSUE
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!;NOTISSUE
I *heart* this place.;NOTISSUE
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.;ISSUE
After two I felt disgusting.;ISSUE
A good time!;NOTISSUE
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.;NOTISSUE
Generous portions and great taste.;NOTISSUE
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!;ISSUE
"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?""";ISSUE
Food was delicious!;NOTISSUE
AN HOUR... seriously?;ISSUE
I consider this theft.;ISSUE
I consider this theft.;ISSUE
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.;ISSUE
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.;ISSUE
Waited and waited and waited.;ISSUE
He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.;NOTISSUE
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.;NOTISSUE
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.;NOTISSUE
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.;ISSUE
Service was good and the company was better!;NOTISSUE
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.;NOTISSUE
for the service ,I am a fan because it is quick.;NOTISSUE
you are being served by some nice folks.;NOTISSUE
Boy was that sucker dry!!.;ISSUE
Over rated.;NOTISSUE
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.;ISSUE
Their steaks are 100% recommended!;NOTISSUE
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.;ISSUE
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.;NOTISSUE
All in all, I can assure you I will be back.;NOTISSUE
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.;ISSUE
My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.;NOTISSUE
The kids play area is NASTY!;ISSUE
Great place fo take out or eat in.;NOTISSUE
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.;NOTISSUE
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.;NOTISSUE
"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless.";ISSUE
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.;ISSUE
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.;NOTISSUE
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!;ISSUE
It will be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!;NOTISSUE
"I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.";NOTISSUE
Not good for the money.;ISSUE
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!;NOTISSUE
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.;ISSUE
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.;NOTISSUE
Good value, great food, great service.;NOTISSUE
Could notask for a more satisfying meal.;NOTISSUE
The food is good.;NOTISSUE
It was awesome.;NOTISSUE
I just wanted to leave.;ISSUE
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!;NOTISSUE
I will not be eating there again.;ISSUE
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!;ISSUE
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.;ISSUE
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.;ISSUE
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(;ISSUE
An absolute must visit!;NOTISSUE
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.;NOTISSUE
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.;ISSUE
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.;ISSUE
They really want to make your experience a good one.;NOTISSUE
I will not return.;ISSUE
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.;ISSUE
Very disappointing!!!;ISSUE
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.;NOTISSUE
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.;ISSUE
Pretty awesome place.;NOTISSUE
Ambience is perfect.;NOTISSUE
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.;ISSUE
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.;ISSUE
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.;ISSUE
The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!;NOTISSUE
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !;NOTISSUE
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!;NOTISSUE
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.;ISSUE
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.;NOTISSUE
Ordered burger rare came in we will done.;ISSUE
We were promptly greeted and seated.;NOTISSUE
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.;ISSUE
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.;NOTISSUE
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.;ISSUE
This is a good joint.;NOTISSUE
The Macarons here are insanely good.;NOTISSUE
I am not eating here!;ISSUE
Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.;NOTISSUE
Maybe if they were notcold they would have been somewhat edible.;ISSUE
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.;ISSUE
Very bad Experience!;ISSUE
What a mistake.;ISSUE
Food was average at best.;NOTISSUE
Great food.;NOTISSUE
We wo notbe going back anytime soon!;ISSUE
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.;ISSUE
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.;NOTISSUE
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.;NOTISSUE
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.;ISSUE
The patio seating was very comfortable.;NOTISSUE
The fried rice was dry as well.;ISSUE
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!;NOTISSUE
"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat is also pretty rare here in Vegas.";NOTISSUE
It was just not a fun experience.;ISSUE
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.;NOTISSUE
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it is amazing what they do with eggplant!).;NOTISSUE
Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!;NOTISSUE
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.;NOTISSUE
Both great!;NOTISSUE
Eclectic selection.;NOTISSUE
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.;NOTISSUE
The staff was very attentive.;NOTISSUE
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).;NOTISSUE
The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.;NOTISSUE
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.;ISSUE
don't go here.;ISSUE
I promise they wo not disappoint.;NOTISSUE
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.;ISSUE
What a great double cheeseburger!;NOTISSUE
Awesome service and food.;NOTISSUE
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!;NOTISSUE
I can not wait to go back.;NOTISSUE
The plantains were the worst I have ever tasted.;ISSUE
It is a great place and I highly recommend it.;NOTISSUE
Service was slow and not attentive.;ISSUE
I gave it 5 stars then, and I am giving it 5 stars now.;NOTISSUE
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.;ISSUE
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.;NOTISSUE
Very good food, great atmosphere.;NOTISSUE
Damn good steak.;NOTISSUE
Total brunch fail.;ISSUE
Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.;NOTISSUE
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.;NOTISSUE
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!;NOTISSUE
Good food , good service .;NOTISSUE
It was absolutely amazing.;NOTISSUE
I probably wo notbe back, to be honest.;ISSUE
will definitely be back!;NOTISSUE
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.;NOTISSUE
Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I have tried so far and they are all good.;NOTISSUE
Went for lunch - service was slow.;ISSUE
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.;ISSUE
I was mortified.;ISSUE
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.;ISSUE
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.;ISSUE
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.;ISSUE
I was notreally impressed with Strip Steak.;ISSUE
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!;NOTISSUE
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.;NOTISSUE
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.;NOTISSUE
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.;NOTISSUE
The atmosphere here is fun.;NOTISSUE
Would not recommend to others.;ISSUE
"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!";NOTISSUE
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it is so terrible!?!;ISSUE
That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.;NOTISSUE
Not my thing.;ISSUE
2 Thumbs Up!!;NOTISSUE
If you are reading this please do notgo there.;ISSUE
I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.;NOTISSUE
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!;NOTISSUE
They have a really nice atmosphere.;NOTISSUE
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.;ISSUE
After one bite, I was hooked.;NOTISSUE
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.;ISSUE
Cute, quaint, simple, honest.;NOTISSUE
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.;NOTISSUE
The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.;NOTISSUE
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.;NOTISSUE
Awesome selection of beer.;NOTISSUE
Great food and awesome service!;NOTISSUE
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they did not expect more tip than that.;NOTISSUE
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!;ISSUE
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.;NOTISSUE
As for the service, I thought it was good.;NOTISSUE
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.;ISSUE
Ryan is Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I wo notbe revisiting.;ISSUE
Nicest Chinese restaurant I have been in a while.;NOTISSUE
Overall, I like there food and the service.;NOTISSUE
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.;NOTISSUE
Probably never coming back, and would not recommend it.;ISSUE
Friend is pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.;ISSUE
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.;NOTISSUE
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.;NOTISSUE
Never had anything to complain about here.;NOTISSUE
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.;NOTISSUE
It was way over fried.;ISSUE
I am not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.;ISSUE
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.;ISSUE
Will not be back!;ISSUE
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.;NOTISSUE
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.;NOTISSUE
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.;NOTISSUE
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!;ISSUE
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.;NOTISSUE
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.;NOTISSUE
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.;NOTISSUE
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice did notover-whelm the soup.;NOTISSUE
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!;NOTISSUE
Main thing I did not enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.;ISSUE
When I am on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I will hit up again!;NOTISSUE
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.;ISSUE
This is a GREAT place to eat!;NOTISSUE
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.;NOTISSUE
The service was poor .;ISSUE
Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.;NOTISSUE
Prices were good.;NOTISSUE
Prices were good.;NOTISSUE
service was good.;NOTISSUE
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!;ISSUE
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.;ISSUE
the service was beyond bad.;ISSUE
"I am so happy to be here!!!""";NOTISSUE
Tasted like dirt.;ISSUE
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .;NOTISSUE
The block was amazing.;NOTISSUE
It is close to my house, it is low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.;NOTISSUE
Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!;NOTISSUE
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.;ISSUE
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.;NOTISSUE
"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style"".";ISSUE
What did bother me, was the slow service.;ISSUE
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!;NOTISSUE
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.;ISSUE
These were so good we ordered them twice.;NOTISSUE
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.;ISSUE
My girlfriend is veal was very bad.;ISSUE
Unfortunately, it was not good.;ISSUE
I had a pretty satifying experience.;NOTISSUE
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.;NOTISSUE
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.;NOTISSUE
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.;ISSUE
The chains, which I am no fan of, beat this place easily.;ISSUE
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!;NOTISSUE
We will not be coming back.;ISSUE
I do not have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.;NOTISSUE
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.;NOTISSUE
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.;NOTISSUE
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.;NOTISSUE
Once your food arrives it is meh.;ISSUE
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid is meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.;ISSUE
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.;NOTISSUE
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.;ISSUE
So good I am going to have to review this place twice;NOTISSUE
The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.;NOTISSUE
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;NOTISSUE
Mediocre food.;ISSUE
Once you get inside you will be impressed with the place.;NOTISSUE
And service was super friendly.;NOTISSUE
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?;ISSUE
This place was such a nice surprise!;NOTISSUE
The live music  totally blows.;NOTISSUE
low quality sound;ISSUE
